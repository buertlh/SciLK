To further explore the variation this paper aimed to examine notification practices among MS by comparing the levels of detection as a function of the total food imported and population. RASFF notifications issued between 2003 and 2007 were analysed using descriptive statistics and network analysis for differences in notification practice between MS. Major variations in contributions to the RASFF database were observed, which did not correlate with MS size or population. For the key contrast of ratio: 'border: non-border notifications', variations between 7%:89% were observed for the average monthly contributions and, import tonnage per border notification revealed up to 129-fold differences between MS. In conclusion, wide variations in food safety practice exist between MS, including both number and type of contributions to the RASFF database, with some MS being relatively highly active in the key class of border notifications.

Although bupropion and naltrexone (alone and in combination) reduce food consumption in rodents and humans, their effects on behaviour during feeding tests have not been thoroughly investigated. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the behavioural specificity of anorectic responses to bupropion, naltrexone and their combination. METHODS: Video analysis was employed to characterise the behavioural effects of acute systemic treatment with bupropion (10.0-40.0\u00a0mg/kg), naltrexone (0.1-3.0\u00a0mg/kg) and combined bupropion (20\u00a0mg/kg) plus naltrexone (0.1-1.0\u00a0mg/kg) in non-deprived male rats exposed for 1\u00a0h to palatable mash. Particular attention was paid to the behavioural satiety sequence (BSS). RESULTS: In experiment 1, the anorectic response to 40\u00a0mg/kg bupropion was associated with significant psychomotor stimulation and a complete disruption of the BSS. In experiment 2, the anorectic response to 3\u00a0mg/kg naltrexone was associated with an accelerated but otherwise normal BSS. In experiment 3, the co-administration of 20\u00a0mg/kg bupropion and naltrexone (0.1 and 1.0\u00a0mg/kg) not only produced an additive anorectic profile (including a reduced rate of eating), but the addition of the opioid receptor antagonist also concurrently attenuated the psychomotor stimulant response to the atypical antidepressant.

Tobacco and MDMA are often consumed together. In the present work we studied the in vivo effect of a classic chronic dosing schedule of MDMA in rats, alone or combined with a chronic schedule of NIC, on the density of nAChR and on serotonin reuptake transporters.

We used hydrophilic polystyrene colloids with four different shapes (spheres, barrels, rods, and oblong disks), but otherwise identical surface properties. The nonspherical shapes were created by stretching spherical microspheres on a film of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The colloids were then deposited onto the inner surface of a glass channel. An air bubble was introduced into the channel and passed through, thereby generating a receding followed by an advancing air-water interface. The detachment of colloids by the air-water interfaces was visualized with a confocal microscope, quantified by image analysis, and analyzed statistically to determine significant differences. For all colloid shapes, the advancing air-water interface caused pronounced colloid detachment (>63%), whereas the receding interface was ineffective in colloid detachment (<1.5%). Among the different colloid shapes, the barrels were most readily removed (94%) by the advancing interface, followed by the spheres and oblong disks (80%) and the rods (63%). Colloid detachment was significantly affected by colloid shape. The presence of an edge, as it occurs in a barrel-shaped colloid, promoted colloid detachment because the air-water interface is being pinned at the edge of the colloid.

The dominant reactions are near-thermoneutral proton and deuteron transfer, generating HCO(+) and DCO(+) product ions by a predominantly direct mechanism. The HCO(+) and DCO(+) channels occur with a combined efficiency of 76% for ground state HOD(+) at our lowest E(col), increasing to 94% for E(col) around 0.33 eV, then falling at high E(col) to ~40%. The HCO(+) and DCO(+) channels have a complicated dependence on the HOD(+) vibrational state. Excitation of the OH or OD stretch modes enhances H(+) or D(+) transfer, respectively, and inhibits D(+) or H(+) transfer. Bend excitation preferentially enhances H(+) transfer, with no effect on D(+) transfer. There is no coupling of energy initially in any HOD(+) vibrational mode to recoil velocity of either of the product ions, even at low E(col) where vibrational excitation doubles or triples the energy available to products.

Interestingly, altered expression of nonactivated caspase-14 proenzyme is associated with tumorigenesis and diabetic retinopathy, suggesting that caspase-14 may perform physiological functions independently of its protease activity. Here, we performed tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry analysis to identify caspase-14 proenzyme as a GCM1-interacting protein that suppresses GCM1 activity and syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. Immunohistochemistry revealed that caspase-14 and GCM1 colocalize to placental cytotrophoblast cells at 8 wk of gestation and syncytiotrophoblast layer at term. Further, we demonstrated that caspase-14 mRNA level is decreased by 40% in placental BeWo cells treated with forskolin (FSK). To the contrary, stimulation of GCM1-regulated placental cell fusion and human chorionic gonadotropin \u03b2 (hCG\u03b2) expression by FSK is enhanced by caspase-14 knockdown.

Melanin content was measured after spontaneous melanogenesis, UVB-induced melanogenesis and melanogenesis induced by \u03b1-MSH. At the same time, cell viability assays were conducted.

RESULTS: HEGG decreased the level of melanin under all three experimental conditions of melanin content evaluation without reducing cell viability. In intracellular tyrosinase assays, the enzyme's activity was reduced about 19% with extract concentrations ranging 0.1-10\u00b5g/mL.

The use of a tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC) has been proposed as a novel menopausal hormone therapy strategy to eliminate the requirement for a progestogen. Combination of bazedoxifene (BZA) with conjugated estrogens (CEs), the first TSEC, has shown beneficial effects. Whether it would exert antiestrogenic effects on breast cancer is not clear. To address this issue, we compared estradiol (E(2)) and CE alone on proliferation and apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. CE stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells at a peak concentration 10-fold higher than required for E(2). Both CE and E(2) alone increased DNA synthesis and reduced apoptosis with activation of MAPK, Akt, and p70S6K and up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors survivin, Bcl-2, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, These effects could be completely blocked by BZA. Gene expression studies demonstrated that CE and E(2) were equally potent on expression of cMyc, pS2, and WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2, whereas the stimulatory effects of CE on progesterone receptor and amphiregulin expression were weaker than E(2). BZA effectively blocked each of these effects and showed no estrogen agonistic effects when used alone.

The sensing mechanism of our Mid-IR waveguide sensor is based on evanescent wave absorption by functional groups of the surrounding chemical molecules, which selectively absorb specific wavelengths in the mid-IR, depending on the nature of their chemical bonds. From a measurement of the waveguide mode intensities, we demonstrate in situ identification of chemical compositions and concentrations of organic solvents. For instance, we show that when testing at \u03bb = 3.55 \u03bcm, the Mid-IR sensor can distinguish hexane from the rest of the tested analytes (methanol, toluene, carbon tetrachloride, ethanol and acetone), since hexane has a strong absorption from the aliphatic C-H stretch at \u03bb = 3.55 \u03bcm.

The PL photon energy obtained from as-prepared samples decreased by 0.1-0.3 eV, while the PL excitation (PLE) extended from 360 nm (octyl-capped Si QDs) to 400 nm (2-phenylvinyl-capped Si QDs). A vibrational PL feature was observed in all samples with an energy separation of about 0.192\u00b10.013 eV, which was explained based on electron-phonon coupling. After soft oxidization through drying, all samples showed blue PL with maxima at approximately 410 nm. A similar high-energy peak was observed with the bare Si QD sample.

In this bottom-up approach, the underlying support is an e-beam formed, square lattice pattern of hemispheres. This curvature pattern sorts Cu(2+)-DOIDA to the 200 nm hemispherical lattice sites of a 600 nm X 600 nm unit cell in Ld - Lo phase separated lipid multibilayers. Binding of histidine-tagged green fluorescent protein (His-GFP) creates a high density array of His-GFP-bound pixels localized to the square lattice sites. In comparison, the negative pixel pattern is created by sorting Cu(2+)-DSIDA in Ld - L\u03b2' phase separated lipid multibilayers to the flat grid between the lattice sites followed by binding to His-GFP. Lattice defects in the His-GFP pattern lead to interesting features such as pattern circularity.
