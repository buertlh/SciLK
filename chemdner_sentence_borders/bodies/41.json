White adipose tissue secretes the 16\u00a0kDa hormone leptin which plays a key role in the regulation of appetite and metabolism. An increasing number of reports indicate that leptin also interferes with signal transduction pathways implicated in the development of breast cancer. In our previous study, we identified the estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) as a relevant enhancer of leptin-induced signal transduction leading to transactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). The purpose of this study is the investigation of specific target gene expression in response to leptin-mediated Stat3 signaling. We performed a comprehensive microarray analysis of ER\u03b1-positive and ER\u03b1-negative MDA-MB-231 cells upon leptin treatment and identified 49 genes which showed a significant ER\u03b1-dependent regulation in leptin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. There was no intersection with genes which were merely up- or downregulated by ER\u03b1 expression and only 9 and 11 genes overlapping targets which were regulated by leptin stimulation either in ER\u03b1-expressing or ER\u03b1-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. To demonstrate the specificity, expression of three target genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. In conclusion, these data imply that leptin can induce a different set of target genes dependent on ER\u03b1 expression, which might contribute to the development and progression of cancer diseases.", "anno": [[107, 108, true], [232, 233, true], [383, 384, true], [605, 606, true], [735, 736, true], [968, 969, true], [1222, 1223, true], [1332, 1333, true], [1526, 1527, true]]}, {"id": 23270990, "text": "Valine residues in the pore region of SK2 (V366) and SK3 (V520) were replaced by either an alanine or a phenylalanine to evaluate the impact on the interactions with the allosteric blocker apamin.

In addition, currents from phenylalanine mutants were largely resistant to block by apamin. On the other hand, when the valine residue was replaced by an alanine residue, an increase of the binding affinity and the amount of block by apamin was observed for alanine mutated SK2 channels, but not for mutated SK3 channels. Interestingly, the VA mutation reduced the sensitivity to TEA. In silico data confirmed these experimental results.

However, depth recordings made directly from the dentate granule cell layers in awake rats after convulsive status epilepticus-induced injury have now shown that whenever perforant pathway stimulation-induced status epilepticus produces extensive hilar neuron loss and entorhinal cortical injury, hyperexcitable granule cells immediately generate spontaneous epileptiform discharges and focal or generalized behavioral seizures. This indicates that hippocampal injury caused by convulsive status epilepticus is immediately epileptogenic and that hippocampal epileptogenesis requires no delayed secondary mechanism. When latent periods do exist after injury, we hypothesize that less extensive cell loss causes an extended period during which initially subclinical focal seizures gradually increase in duration to produce the first clinical seizure. Thus, the \"latent period\" is suggested to be a state of \"epileptic maturation,\" rather than a prolonged period of \"epileptogenesis,\" and therefore the antiepileptogenic therapeutic window may only remain open during the first week after injury, when some delayed cell death may still be preventable.

METHODS: Sixty-seven adult participants were given an acute dose of 20\u00a0mg cortisol in a placebo-controlled, within-subject, counter-balanced dosing design. Salivary cortisol was measured at baseline and at regular intervals across a 5\u00a0h testing period. Following dosing, state-aggressive behavior was measured by a laboratory task, the Point-Subtraction Aggression Paradigm. History of child abuse/neglect, psychopathy, impulsivity, and a trait measure of aggression were assessed through self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Using multiple regression, a model including abuse/neglect, psychopathy, impulsivity, and baseline cortisol explained 58\u00a0% of the variance in trait aggression and 26\u00a0% of the variance in state aggression. Abuse/neglect predicted diminished HPA-axis reactivity and HPA-axis reactivity showed a trend toward predicting state and trait aggression, although it was not a significant mediating variable between abuse/neglect and aggression.

A series of nC(60) samples were prepared using a modified toluene-water solvent-exchange method through the inclusion of a secondary organic solvent in the phase transfer of molecular C(60) in toluene to nC(60) in water. Two groups of solvents--a water-miscible group and a non-water-miscible group-of varied polarity were selected as secondary solvents. The involvement of a secondary solvent in the phase transfer process had only small effects on the particle size and distribution, \u03b6 potential, and mobility of the nC(60) products but significantly influenced the capability of nC(60) to enhance the transport of 2,2',5,5'-polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in a saturated sandy soil column, regardless of whether the secondary solvent was water-miscible or non-water-miscible. The two groups of secondary solvents appear to affect the aggregation properties of nC(60) in water via different mechanisms. In general, nC(60) products made with a secondary water-miscible solvent have stronger capabilities to enhance PCB transport.

Thus, although most Pygmy populations have patrilocal customs, their sex-specific genetic patterns resemble those of matrilocal populations. In fact, our results are consistent with a lower prevalence of polygyny and patrilocality in Pygmies compared with non-Pygmies and a potential female transmission of reproductive success in Pygmies. Finally, Pygmy populations showed variable admixture levels with the non-Pygmies, with often much larger introgression from male than from female lineages. Social discrimination against Pygmies triggering complex movements of spouses in intermarriages can explain these male-biased admixture patterns in a patrilocal context.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation and migration were used to evaluate the angiogenic effects of HCS, LCS and total extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza (TES). Microarray technology was applied to detect the gene expression of HUVECs treated with TES, HCS and LCS. Besides, quantitative real-time PCR was used to verify the microarray results. RESULTS: Our results showed that LCS inhibited the proliferation and migration of HUVECs, HCS promoted the proliferation and migration of HUVECs, and TES did not affect the viability of HUVECs at the concentration of 5\u00b5g/mL. From the result of principle component analysis (PCA) of microarray data, the effect of LCS on HUVECs was significantly different from the other components.

At the molecular level, mRNA expression of the master adipogenic transcription factors, PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1, was decreased markedly.

Less clear are the underlying mechanisms responsible. This commentary points out the likely sources of decreased resistance to fracture using lessons from bone material studies and biomechanics. We hypothesize that the key element in the cascade of events leading to failure of the largest and strongest bone in the human body is long-term suppression of normal bone turnover caused by exposure to potent anti-remodeling agents, most notably the bisphosphonates (BPs). Suppressed bone turnover produces changes in bone that alter its material quality and these changes could lead to adverse effects on its mechanical function. At the submicroscopic [<1\u03bcm] level of collagen fibrils, suppression of bone turnover allows continued addition of non-enzymatic cross links that can reduce collagen's plasticity and this in turn contributes to reduced bone toughness. Further, adverse changes in hydroxyapatite crystalline structure and composition can occur, perhaps increasing collagen's brittleness. At the microscopic level [~1-500\u03bcm] of the bone-matrix structure, suppressed bone turnover allows full mineralization of cortical bone osteons and results in a microstructure of bone that is more homogeneous. Both brittleness and loss of heterogeneity allow greater progression of microscopic cracks that can occur with usual physical activity; in crack mechanical terms, normal mechanisms that dissipate crack tip growth energy are greatly reduced and crack progression is less impeded. Further, the targeted repair of cracks by newly activated BMUs appears to be preferentially suppressed by BPs. We further hypothesize that it is not necessary to have accumulation of many cracks to produce an AFF, just one that progresses - one that is not stopped by bone's several protective mechanisms and is allowed to penetrate through a homogeneous environment. The remarkable straight transverse fracture line is an indicator of the slow progression of a \"mother crack\" and the failure of usual mechanisms to bridge or deflect the crack. Research in AFF mechanisms has been focused at the organ level, describing the clinical presentation and radiologic appearance.

Permeability coefficients for up to 28 drugs were determined using one or several of four intestinal regions: duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon and 10 drugs were studied bidirectionally.

A clear sigmoidal relationship was also obtained between P(app) in colonic segments and f(a) after colonic administration in humans for a set of 10 drugs (R(2): 0.93, p<0.05). Regional permeability data showed a tendency for highly permeable compounds to have higher or similar P(app) in colon as in the small intestinal segments, while the colonic regions showed a lower P(app) for more polar compounds as well as for d-glucose and l-leucine. Bidirectional transport (mucosa to serosa and serosa to mucosa direction) in jejunum showed well functioning efflux- and uptake asymmetry.

The aim of the present retrospective study was to determine the amount per application and the daily exposure for some of the most commonly used baby cosmetic products. Consumption data from 48 clinical studies performed on 1481 babies and children (from 0 to 10years old) were reviewed and used to conduct a probabilistic evaluation of dermal exposure. Six categories of products were reviewed: rinseoff products for hair and body; rinse-off products for the whole body; leave-on products for face and body; cleansers for face and body; diaper dermatitis treatment products; shampoos. Subjects were provided with products and recorded detailed daily usage information over a 1-4-week period, depending on the study. Products were weighed at the start and upon completion of each study in order to determine the total amount of product used. The mean, median, standard deviation and 95th percentile were calculated for daily consumption and exposure, for several age groups from 0 to 10years old.

This is the first report on extraction of nine additional flavonoids from the ber fruits. In addition, we also compared the impact of three different base hydrolysis techniques namely ultrasonic assisted base hydrolysis (UABH), microwave assisted base hydrolysis (MWABH), and pressurised liquid assisted base hydrolysis (PLABH) for the quantification of total phenolic acids. Nine phenolic acids, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, ortho- and para-coumaric acids, were identified and quantified. The three major phenolic acids identified in all four ber species were p-coumaric acid, vanillin and ferulic acids.

Unlike conventional colorimetric techniques, label-free detection of cytokines enables studying cellular secretions in real time by eliminating additional wash and labeling steps after the binding step. However, label-free techniques that are based on measuring mass accumulation on a sensor surface are challenging for measuring small cytokines binding to much larger capture agents (usually antibodies) because the relative signal change is small. This problem is exacerbated when the capturing antibodies desorb from the surface, a phenomenon that almost inevitably occurs in immunoassays but is rarely accounted for. Here, we demonstrate a quantitative dynamic detection of interleukine-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, using an interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (IRIS). We improved the accuracy of the quantitative analysis of this relatively small protein (21 kDa) by characterizing the antibody desorption rate and compensating for the antibody loss during the binding experiment. By correcting for protein desorption, we achieved an analytical limit of detection at 19 ng/mL IL-6 concentration. We enhanced the sensitivity by 7-fold by using detection antibodies that recognize a different epitope of the cytokine. We demonstrate that these detection antibodies, which we call \"mass tags\", can be used concurrently with the target analyte to eliminate an additional wash and binding step. Finally, we report successful label-free detection of IL-6 in cell culture medium (with 10% serum) with comparable signal to that obtained in PBS.
