Here, we report that Golgi fragmentation induced by brefeldin A (BFA) or coatomer protein (\u03b2-COP) knockdown (KD) in Panc1-bC2GnT-M (c-Myc) cells is accompanied by the increased association of NMIIA with C2GnT-M and its degradation by proteasomes.

Using multiple approaches, we have shown that the speed of BFA-induced Golgi fragmentation is positively correlated with the levels of this enzyme in the Golgi. The observation is reproduced in LNCaP cells which express high levels of two endogenous glycosyltransferases-C2GnT-L and \u03b2-galactoside \u03b12,3 sialyltransferase 1. NMIIA is found to form complexes with these two enzymes but not Golgi matrix proteins. The KD of both enzymes or the prevention of Golgi glycosyltransferases from exiting endoplasmic reticulum reduced Golgi-associated NMIIA and decreased the BFA-induced fragmentation. Interestingly, the fragmented Golgi detected in colon cancer HT-29 cells can be restored to a compact morphology after inhibition or KD of NMIIA. The Golgi disorganization induced by the microtubule or actin destructive agent is NMIIA-independent and does not affect the levels of glycosyltransferases.

In thyroid cancer cell lines, romidepsin increases expression of both thyroglobulin and the sodium iodide symporter messenger RNAs, suggesting the possibility of improved iodine concentrating ability of RAI-resistant tumors. Methods: This was a single-institution Simon 2-stage phase II clinical study. Eligible patients had progressive, RAI-refractory, recurrent/metastatic, nonmedullary, nonanaplastic thyroid cancer. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 measurable disease and adequate organ/marrow function were required. Romidepsin 13\u2009mg/m(2) was administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15, in cycles of 28 days. The primary endpoint was the response rate by RECIST; change in RAI avidity was a secondary endpoint. The study closed after the first stage due to the lack of response.

Various genetic, hormonal and environmental factors may lead to structural changes in the vein valves and make them incompetent, leading to venous reflux, increased venous pressure and vein wall dilation. Prolonged increases in venous pressure and vein wall tension are thought to increase the expression/activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Members of the MMPs family include collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysins, membrane- type MMPs and others. MMPs are known to degrade various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMPs may also affect the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle, causing changes in the vein relaxation and contraction mechanisms. Endothelial cell injury also triggers leukocyte infiltration, activation and inflammation, which lead to further vein wall damage. The vein wall dilation and valve dysfunction, and the MMP activation and superimposed inflammation and fibrosis would lead to progressive venous dilation and VVs formation.

What has been lacking is a strategy to design ELPs to respond to specific substrates. To address this deficiency, we report that ELP fusion proteins phase separate in response to chemical inducers of dimerization (CID). The rationale is that ELP phase separation depends on molecular weight, concentration, and local hydrophobicity; therefore, processes that affect these properties, including noncovalent dimerization, can be tuned to produce isothermal phase separation. To test this hypothesis, constructs were evaluated consisting of an immunophilin: human FK-506 binding protein 12 (FKBP) attached to an ELP. Under stoichiometric binding of a CID, the fusion protein homodimerizes and triggers phase separation. This dimerization is reversible upon saturation with excess CID or competitive binding of a small lipophilic macrolide to FKBP. By modulating the ELP molecular weight, phase separation was tuned for isothermal response to CID at physiological ionic strength and temperature (37 \u00b0C). To interpret the relationship between transition temperature and equilibrium binding constants, an empirical mathematical model was employed.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are potent growth factors that promote bone formation. Previously, we found that Glypican-1 (GPC1) and Glypican-3 (GPC3) are expressed in cranial sutures and are decreased during premature suture fusion in children. Although glypicans are known to regulate BMP signalling, a mechanistic link between GPC1, GPC3 and BMPs and osteogenesis has not yet been investigated. We now report that human primary suture mesenchymal cells coexpress GPC1 and GPC3 on the cell surface and release them into the media. We show that they inhibit BMP2, BMP4 and BMP7 activities, which both physically interact with BMP2 and that immunoblockade of endogenous GPC1 and GPC3 potentiates BMP2 activity. In contrast, increased levels of GPC1 and GPC3 as a result of overexpression or the addition of recombinant protein, inhibit BMP2 signalling and BMP2-mediated osteogenesis. We demonstrate that BMP signalling in suture mesenchymal cells is mediated by both SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways and that GPC1 and GPC3 inhibit both pathways. GPC3 inhibition of BMP2 activity is independent of attachment of the glypican on the cell surface and post-translational glycanation, and thus appears to be mediated by the core glypican protein.

These antagonistic factors are optimized in the target heterotrimer that forms the maximum number of charge pairs and minimizes unpaired charged residues. Additionally, we find that not just the number of paired and unpaired residues are important, but also the type.

METHODS: Seventy-one FH patients (39\u00b115years, LDL-cholesterol=274\u00b1101; HDL-cholesterol=50\u00b114mg/dl) and 66 normolipidemic subjects (NL) (38\u00b111years, LDL-cholesterol=105\u00b127; HDL-cholesterol=52\u00b112mg/dl) were studied. In vitro, lipid transfers were evaluated by incubation of plasma samples (37\u00b0C, 1h) with a donor lipid nanoemulsion labeled with 3H-triglycerides (TG) and 14C-unesterified cholesterol (UC) or with 3H-cholesteryl ester (EC) and 14C-phospholipids (PL). Radioactivity was counted at the HDL fraction after chemical precipitation of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins and the nanoemulsion.

RESULTS: Transfer of UC to HDL was lower in FH than in NL (5.6\u00b12.1 vs 6.7\u00b12.0%, p=0.0005) whereas TG (5.5\u00b13.1 vs 3.7\u00b10.9%, p=0.018) and PL (20.9\u00b14.6 vs 18.2\u00b13.7 %, p=0.023) transfers were higher in FH.

On the basis of their location within VSV-G, we analyzed whether substitutions in several surface exposed residues could endow viral vectors with higher resistance to serum. S162T, T230N and T368A mutations enhanced serum resistance, and additionally K66T, T368A and E380K substitutions increased the thermostability of VSV-G pseudotyped retroviral vectors, an advantageous byproduct of the selection strategy.

SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies demonstrated biodegradability as well as elimination of mP-PTX from the body. The tumors in the mP-PTX treated group grew more slowly than those treated with saline, free PTX, and P-PTX (single dose at 20 mg PTX/kg equivalent). Moreover, mice treated with mP-PTX had no obvious ascites and body-weight loss. Histological analysis indicated that mP-PTX had no toxicity in liver and spleen, but induced massive cell death in the tumor. In summary, this biodegradable drug delivery system has a great potential to improve performance and safety of current antineoplastic agents.", "anno": [[128, 129, true], [275, 276, true], [435, 436, true], [560, 561, true], [836, 837, true], [1022, 1023, true], [1137, 1138, true], [1336, 1337, true], [1475, 1476, true], [1598, 1599, true], [1748, 1749, true], [1828, 1829, true], [1954, 1955, true], [2096, 2097, true]]}, {"id": 23373696, "text": "The specificity of polymer conjugates based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) bearing cytostatic drugs for cancer cells could be significantly increased by the incorporation of a suitable targeting ligand, such as a monoclonal antibody (mAb). However, direct binding of the protein to the polymer carrier could cause considerable problems, such as decreasing the binding capacity of mAb to its target. Here, we introduce a novel strategy of joining a targeting moiety to a polymeric conjugate with cytostatic drug. The scFv of B1 mAb (specific for BCL1 leukemia cells) was tagged with peptide K ((VAALKEK)4). Peptide E ((VAALEKE)4), which forms a stable coiled coil structure heterodimer with peptide K, was assembled with the HPMA copolymers bearing doxorubicin. Such targeted polymeric conjugates possess very selective and high binding activity toward BCL1 cells. Similarly, targeted polymeric conjugates exert approximately 100 times higher cytostatic activity toward BCL1 cells in comparison to nontargeted conjugates in vitro. At the same time, the conjugates have comparable and rather low cytostatic activity for 38C13 cells, which are used as a negative control, in vitro.", "anno": [[251, 252, true], [410, 411, true], [523, 524, true], [617, 618, true], [772, 773, true], [875, 876, true], [1041, 1042, true], [1190, 1191, true]]}, {"id": 23322633, "text": "Bioisosterism of \u03b1-amino acids is often accomplished by replacing the \u03b1-carboxylate with one of the many known carboxylic acid bioisosteres. However, bioisosterism of the whole \u03b1-amino acid moiety is accomplished with heterocyclic bioisosteres that often display an acidic function. In this Minireview, we summarized the reported heterocycles as nonclassical bioisosteres of \u03b1-amino acids, which include quinoxaline-2,4(1H)-dione, quinoxaline-2,3(1H)-dione and quinolin-2(1H)-one, azagrevellin and azepine-derived structures. The binding mode of the crystalized bioisosteres were compared with those of the crystalized \u03b1-amino acids that bind in the same domain, and where no data on the crystal structure were available, the displacement studies of known orthosteric ligands were used. The reported bioisosteres share the following essential structural features for mimicking \u03b1-amino acids: an aromatic ring system joined to a lactam ring system with an acidic feature next to the lactam carbonyl, where this acidic feature together with the lactam carbonyl can mimic the \u03b1-carboxylate, and the lactam nitrogen together with the aromatic ring system can mimic the \u03b1-ammonium. The majority of these heterocycles can be prepared from three common corresponding starting materials: the corresponding anilines, isatins or anthranilic esters. The data collected here show the potential of this class of bioisosteres in the design of glutamate receptor ligands and beyond.", "anno": [[139, 140, true], [281, 282, true], [524, 525, true], [785, 786, true], [1175, 1176, true], [1337, 1338, true], [1466, 1467, true]]}, {"id": 23254341, "text": "Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), a key mediator of fibrotic responses, is increased in asthma and drives airway remodeling by inducing expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-\u03b2-induced ECM expression by airway smooth muscle cells and demonstrate a novel link between TGF-\u03b2 and Wingless/integrase 1 (WNT) signaling in ECM deposition. Airway smooth muscle expresses abundant WNT ligands, with the noncanonical WNT-5A being the most profoundly expressed. Interestingly, WNT-5A shows \u223c2-fold higher abundance in airway smooth muscle cells isolated from individuals with asthma than individuals without asthma. WNT-5A is markedly induced in response to TGF-\u03b2 (4-16-fold; EC50 0.3 ng/ml) and is required for collagen and fibronectin expression by airway smooth muscle. WNT-5A engages noncanonical WNT signaling pathways, as inhibition of Ca(2+) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling attenuated this TGF-\u03b2 response, whereas the canonical WNT antagonist Dickkopf 1 (DKK-1) did not. Accordingly, WNT-5A induced JNK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Furthermore, silencing of the WNT-5A receptors Frizzled 8 (FZD8) and RYK attenuated TGF-\u03b2-induced ECM expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that noncanonical WNT-5A signaling is activated by and necessary for TGF-\u03b2-induced ECM production by airway smooth muscle cells, which could have significance in asthma pathogenesis.-Kumawat, K., Menzen, M.
