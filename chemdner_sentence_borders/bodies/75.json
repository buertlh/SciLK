Although OTA is twisted with respect to the base in the nucleobase model, addition of the deoxyribose sugar induces a further twist and restricts rotation about the C-C linkage due to close contacts between OTA and the sugar.

Indeed, it has been shown that co-regulated genes tend to be either neighbors or periodically spaced along the whole chromosome. This study demonstrates that respective gene positioning carries significant information. This novel type of information is combined with traditional sequence information by a machine learning algorithm called PreCisIon. To optimize this combination, PreCisIon builds a strong gene target classifier by adaptively combining weak classifiers based on either local binding sequence or global gene position. This strategy generically paves the way to the optimized incorporation of any future advances in gene target prediction based on local sequence, genome layout or on novel criteria. With the current state of the art, PreCisIon consistently improves methods based on sequence information only. This is shown by implementing a cross-validation analysis of the 20 major TFs from two phylogenetically remote model organisms.

PTH acts on the osteoblast (OB) lineage to regulate bone resorption and formation. PTH also induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), producing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), that can act on both OBs and osteoclasts (OCs). Because intermittent PTH is more anabolic in Cox-2 knockout (KO) than wild type (WT) mice, we hypothesized COX-2 might contribute to the effects of continuous PTH by suppressing PTH-stimulated differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into OBs. We compared effects of continuous PTH on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and primary OBs (POBs) from Cox-2 KO mice, mice with deletion of PGE2 receptors (Ptger4 and Ptger2 KO mice), and WT controls. PTH increased OB differentiation in BMSCs only in the absence of COX-2 expression or activity. In the absence of COX-2, PTH stimulated differentiation if added during the first week of culture. In Cox-2 KO BMSCs, PTH-stimulated differentiation was prevented by adding PGE2 to cultures. Co-culture of POBs with M-CSF-expanded bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) showed that the inhibition of PTH-stimulated OB differentiation required not only COX-2 or PGE2 but also BMMs. Sufficient PGE2 to mediate the inhibitory effect was made by either WT POBs or WT BMMs. The inhibitory effect mediated by COX-2/PGE2 was transferred by conditioned media from RANKL-treated BMMs and could be blocked by osteoprotegerin, which interferes with RANKL binding to its receptor on OC lineage cells. Deletion of Ptger4, but not Ptger2, in BMMs prevented the inhibition of PTH-stimulated OB differentiation. As expected, PGE2 also stimulated OB differentiation, but when given in combination with PTH, the stimulatory effects of both were abrogated. These data suggest that PGE2, acting via EP4R on BMMs committed to the OC lineage, stimulated secretion of a factor or factors that acted to suppress PTH-stimulated OB differentiation.

We investigated the structural shape transitions induced in the QII (G) phase upon complexation with a series of sDNAs (5, 11, 24, and 48 bp) with three types of end structure (\"sticky\" adenine (A)-thymine (T) (dAdT) overhangs, no overhang (blunt), and \"nonsticky\" dTdT overhangs) using synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering. Very short 5 bp sDNA with dAdT overhangs and blunt ends induce coexistence of the QII (G) and the HII (C) phase, with the fraction of QII (G) increasing with temperature. Phase coexistence for blunt 5 bp sDNA is observed from 27 \u00b0C to about 65 \u00b0C, where the HII (C) phase disappears and the temperature dependence of the lattice spacing of the QII (G) phase indicates that the sDNA duplexes melt into single strands.

Our work demonstrates how the combined effects of sDNA length and end structure (which determine the temperature-dependent stacking length) tune the phase behavior of the complexes.

Results and discussion: The size of drug-loaded NPs (drug polymer ratio 1:1) was found to be 89.67\u2009\u00b1\u20096.43\u2009nm. The TEM and SEM images of the formulation suggested that particle size was within 20-100\u2009nm and spherical in shape, smooth morphology and coating of Tween-80 on the NPs was clearly observed. The release behavior of donepezil exhibited a biphasic pattern characterized by an initial burst release followed by a slower and continuous sustained release.

Given that adolescents show reduced sensitivity to aversive effects of many drugs, alterations in the DYN/KOR system may contribute to the prevalence of drug use during adolescence. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to assess dysphoric properties of a selective kappa agonist, U62,066, in adolescent and adult rats using both conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigms. METHODS: For CTA, water-restricted rats were administered U62,066 following 30\u00a0min access to a saccharin solution, with subsequent saccharin consumption used to index aversion. For CPA, animals were allowed access to both compartments of a two-compartment chamber for a 15-min pre- and post-conditioning test. For conditioning, subjects were administered U62,066 prior to confinement to one side of the chamber and saline prior to confinement to the other side for a total of four pairings. RESULTS: Overall, adolescents displayed reduced sensitivity to the kappa agonist relative to adults. Adults demonstrated taste aversions to the 0.2 and 0.3\u00a0mg/kg doses of U62,066, whereas adolescents did not display aversions to any tested doses. Adults demonstrated a place aversion to the 0.1 and 0.2\u00a0mg/kg dose of U62,066 when paired with the preferred side of the conditioning chamber.

Although some important mechanisms that might contribute to the death of motor neurons have been identified, the mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology are still uncertain. In particular, the mechanisms underlying the role of gender in ALS and whether treatments should take into account sexual dimorphism remain only partially understood. Recently, the P2X7 receptor for ATP was reported to display neurotoxic potential in motor neuron disorders, and antagonism of the receptor has been suggested to be helpful in these disorders. Studying transgenic mice with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations, widely used as model for ALS, may provide a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and of toxicity towards motor neurons, also possibly helping to understand whether treatments for ALS should take into account sexual dimorphism. The aim of the work was (1) investigating on gender-dependence of disease progression in the standard model for ALS - the transgenic mouse bearing superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations - and (2) assessing if a P2X7 receptor antagonist treatment should take into account sexual dimorphism. We evaluated if gender affect the disease course, the motor performance, the weight loss and the lifespan in mice overexpressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1. We measured motor impairment, motor strength and coordination by rotarod and grip strength testing. Further, we assessed if a treatment with the P2X7 receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue G - a dye that can cross the blood-brain barrier, has low toxicity, and has exhibited therapeutic effects in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases - impact on the disease progression, in male and female ALS mice. We found that (1) the onset and the disease progression, and the survival were dependent on gender: male performed worst than female, lost body weight and died before; (2) treatment with the P2X7 receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue G ameliorated the disease progression. The treatment effect was gender-dependent: amelioration was greater in male than in female. In conclusions, we suggest that not only pathogenetic mechanism of motor neuron toxicity but also the drug treatment effectiveness may depend on gender; sexual dimorphism should be considered when investigating on ALS treatment efficacy in the ALS animal model.

The concentration of Se in plants cultured in 10 mg Se(IV) L(-1) ranged from 436 to 839 \u03bcg Se g(-1) DM in M. spicatum, 319 to 988 \u03bcg Se g(-1) DM in C. demersum and 310 to 661 \u03bcg Se g(-1) DM in P. perfoliatus. The amount of soluble Se compounds in enzyme extracts of high Se treatment was 27% in M. spicatum, 41% in C. demersum and 35% in P. perfoliatus. Se compounds were determined using HPLC-ICP-MS.

Organization of proficiency test programs provided good evidence to facilitate granting laboratories accreditation and to ascertain the measurement reliability of melamine methods. Metabolic studies demonstrated that melamine is predominantly restricted to blood or extracellular fluid and is not extensively distributed to organs and tissues. Studies of human renal histopathology and clinical diagnoses indicated that melamine-related obstructive nephropathy derives from melamine precipitation in the lower urinary tract, with stones that are thought to be melamine-uric acid complexes. Epidemiologic studies showed that the occurrence of melamine-related urolithiasis is related to both the concentration of melamine in ingested milk products and the duration of ingestion. Long-term follow-up cohort studies should be continued to further investigate the epidemic and chronic hazard of melamine-induced nephrotoxicity.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present study was to examine the effect of PCP (0.25 or 0.5\u00a0mg/ml) withdrawal on impulsive choice for SACC in females during the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In component 1, PCP and water were available from two drinking spouts for 1.5\u00a0h sessions under concurrent FR 16 schedules. In component 2, a SACC solution was available for 45\u00a0min under a DD schedule. Monkeys had a choice of one immediate SACC delivery (0.6\u00a0ml) or six delayed SACC deliveries, and the delay was increased by 1\u00a0s after a response on the delayed lever and decreased by 1\u00a0s after a response on the immediate lever. There was then a 10-day water substitution phase, or PCP withdrawal, that occurred during the mid-follicular phase (days\u00a07-11) or the late luteal phase (days\u00a024-28) of the menstrual cycle. Access to PCP and concurrent water was then restored, and the PCP withdrawal procedure was repeated over several follicular and luteal menstrual phases. RESULTS: PCP deliveries were higher during the luteal (vs follicular) phase. Impulsive choice was greater during the luteal (vs follicular) phase during withdrawal of the higher PCP concentration. CONCLUSIONS: PCP withdrawal was associated with elevated impulsive choice for SACC, especially in the luteal (vs follicular) phase of the menstrual cycle in female monkeys.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [396, 397, true], [408, 409, true], [606, 607, true], [629, 630, true], [752, 753, true], [830, 831, true], [1058, 1059, true], [1247, 1248, true], [1400, 1401, true], [1409, 1410, true], [1477, 1478, true], [1597, 1598, true], [1610, 1611, true], [1770, 1771, true]]}, {"id": 23587873, "text": "Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is an autoimmune disorder and the main extrathyroidal expression of Graves' disease. There is a spectrum of ocular involvement in Graves' disease, from complete absence of symptoms and signs to sight-threatening conditions. The prevalence of GO varies in different published series of Graves' patients, due to confounding factors (new diagnosis vs. long-lasting disease, way of defining and assessing ocular involvement, treatment of hyperthyroidism with potentially GO-modifying treatments, such as radioiodine). Recent studies, however, suggest that most Graves' patients have mild or no GO at presentation, while moderate-to-severe GO is rare, and sight-threatening GO (mostly due to dysthyroid optic neuropathy) is exceptional in non-tertiary referral centers. The natural course of GO is incompletely defined, particularly in patients with moderate-to12 severe GO, because these patients require prompt and disease-modifying therapies for orbital disease. In patients with mild GO at presentation, progression to severe forms is rare, while partial or complete remission is frequent. Progression of preexisting GO or de novo occurrence of GO is more likely in smokers. There seems to be a trend towards a decline in progression of GO, possibly due to a better control of risk factors (cigarette smoking, thyroid dysfunction, etc.) and a closer interaction between endocrinologists and ophthalmologists allowing an improved integrated management of thyroid and orbital disease.", "anno": [[108, 109, true], [247, 248, true], [537, 538, true], [788, 789, true], [984, 985, true], [1112, 1113, true], [1197, 1198, true], [1505, 1506, true]]}, {"id": 23497872, "text": "Several mushroom species have been pointed out as sources of antioxidant compounds, in addition to their important nutritional value.
