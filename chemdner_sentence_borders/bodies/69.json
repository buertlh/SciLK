The selection criteria included prospective cohort paediatric studies which use age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) as a measure of childhood overweight and the primary outcome of incident asthma. A total of 1,027 studies were initially identified through online database searches, and finally 6 studies met the inclusion criteria. The combined result of reported relative risk from the 6 included studies revealed that overweight children conferred increased risks of incident asthma as compared with non-overweight children (relative risk, 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.37). The relationship was further elevated for obesity vs. non-obesity (relative risk, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.16-3.50). A dose-responsiveness of elevated BMI on asthma incidence was observed (P for trend, 0.004). Obese boys had a significantly larger effect than obese girls (relative risk, boys: 2.47; 95% CI, 1.57-3.87; girls: 1.25; 95% CI, 0.51-3.03), with significant dose-dependent effect.

Nitric oxide is a potent regulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which drives cGMP production, causing vasorelaxation. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and while iNOS expression increases during late gestation, little is known about how cyclic stretch impacts this pathway. In this study, PASMC were subjected to cyclic stretch of 20% amplitude and frequency of 1 Hz for 24 h and compared to control cells maintained under static conditions. Cyclic stretch significantly increased cytosolic oxidative stress as compared to static cells (62.9 \u00b1 5.9% vs. 33.3 \u00b1 5.7% maximal oxidation), as measured by the intracellular redox sensor roGFP. Cyclic stretch also increased sGC\u03b2 protein expression (2.5 \u00b1 0.9-fold), sGC activity (1.5 \u00b1 0.2-fold) and cGMP levels (1.8 \u00b1 0.2-fold), as well as iNOS mRNA and protein expression (3.0 \u00b1 0.9 and 2.6 \u00b1 0.7-fold, respectively) relative to control cells. An antioxidant, recombinant human superoxide dismutase (rhSOD), significantly decreased stretch-induced cytosolic oxidative stress, but did not block stretch-induced sGC activity. Inhibition of iNOS with 1400 W or an iNOS-specific siRNA inhibited stretch-induced sGC activity by 30% and 68% respectively vs. static controls. In conclusion, cyclic stretch increases sGC expression and activity in an iNOS-dependent manner in PASMC from fetal lambs. The mechanism that produces iNOS and sGC upregulation is not yet known, but we speculate these effects represent an early compensatory mechanism to counteract the effects of stretch-induced oxidative stress.

OBJECTIVES: We therefore aimed to explore the effect of nicotine intake on cortical excitability in healthy human smokers and non-smokers. METHODS: The primary motor cortex served as model, and cortical excitability was monitored via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Corticospinal excitability and intracortical excitability were recorded before and after application of nicotine patch in both groups. Corticospinal excitability was explored by motor threshold and input/output curve (I/O curve), and intracortical excitability was explored by means of paired-pulse TMS techniques (intracortical facilitation (ICF), short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI), I-wave facilitation and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI)). RESULTS: The results show that smokers during nicotine withdrawal display increased corticospinal excitability with regard to the I/O curve (TMS intensity 150\u00a0% of resting motor threshold) compared to non-smokers and furthermore enhanced SAI and diminished ICF at the intracortical circuit level. After administration of nicotine, intracortical facilitation in smokers increased, while in non-smokers, inhibition (SICI, SAI) was enhanced.

We hypothesized that CREB is activated by a distinct signaling pathway in response to pulsatile GnRH in a frequency-dependent manner to dictate the FSH\u03b2 transcriptional response. GnRH stimulation of CREB phosphorylation (pCREB) in the gonadotrope-derived L\u03b2T2 cell line was attenuated by a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89. A dominant negative PKA (DNPKA) reduced GnRH-stimulated pCREB and markedly decreased GnRH stimulation of FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH\u03b2LUC activity, but had little effect on LH\u03b2LUC activity, indicating relative specificity of this pathway. In perifusion studies, FSH\u03b2 mRNA levels and FSH\u03b2LUC activities were increased by pulsatile GnRH, with significantly greater increases at low compared with high pulse frequencies. DNPKA markedly reduced these GnRH-stimulated FSH\u03b2 responses at both low and high pulse frequencies. Correlating with FSH\u03b2 activation, both PKA activity and levels of pCREB were increased to a greater extent by low compared with high GnRH pulse frequencies, and the induction of pCREB was also attenuated by overexpression of DNPKA at both low and high pulse frequencies. Taken together, these data indicate that a PKA-mediated signaling pathway mediates GnRH activation of CREB at low-pulse frequencies, playing a significant role in the decoding of the hypothalamic GnRH signal to result in frequency-dependent FSH\u03b2 activation.", "anno": [[99, 100, true], [312, 313, true], [491, 492, true], [641, 642, true], [869, 870, true], [1048, 1049, true], [1148, 1149, true], [1419, 1420, true], [1677, 1678, true]]}, {"id": 23425199, "text": "Carbamate and urea derivatives are important classes of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors that carbamoylate the active-site nucleophile Ser241.

In particular, we demonstrate that DADS elicits: i) the increase of PGC1\u03b1 within nuclear compartment; ii) the decrease of PGC1\u03b1 non-active acetylated form; iii) the induction of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes such as TFAM and TFBM1. We also show an accumulation of PGC1\u03b1 within mitochondria along with an increased association with the regulatory D-Loop region of mtDNA and a concomitant augmented expression of mitochondrial RNA. Such events are related to a prompt elevation of mitochondrial mass, as assessed by evaluating the content of mtDNA. We show that the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis is directed to dampen the cytotoxic effect of DADS. Indeed, PGC1\u03b1 overexpression or down-regulation prevents or exacerbates mtDNA loss and apoptosis.

The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation.

Here we thoroughly analyse the adsorption energy of nitrate with DFT calculations on various surface facets of pure Au, Ag, and their near-surface and surface alloys, as the adsorption and subsequent reduction of nitrate are thought to be rate limiting in the electrocatalytic reaction. The observed systematic trends allow prediction of the surface with highest electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of nitrate. This prediction was verified experimentally by depositing sub-monolayer amounts of Ag on polycrystalline Au electrodes. We observe a well-defined volcano curve which correlates the amount of Ag deposited on the surface with the current density at a fixed potential, with the peak activity around 2/3 ML Ag surface coverage.

Plasma concentration and urinary excretion profiles were simulated and renal clearance (CL(r)) was calculated for two pharmacokinetic models describing active renal reabsorption (R1/R2), two models describing active secretion (S1/S2), and a model containing both processes. A range of doses (1-1,000 mg/kg) was evaluated, and V (max) and K (m) parameter estimates were varied over a 100-fold range. Similar CL(r) values were predicted for reabsorption models (R1/R2) with variations in V (max) and K (m). Tubular secretion models (S1/S2) yielded similar relationships between Michaelis-Menten parameter perturbations and CL(r), but the predicted CL(r) values were threefold higher for model S1. For both reabsorption and secretion models, the greatest changes in CL(r) were observed with perturbations in V (max), suggesting the need for an accurate estimate of this parameter. When intrinsic clearance was substituted for Michaelis-Menten parameters, it failed to predict similar CL(r) values even within the linear range. For models S1 and S2, renal secretion was predominant at low doses, whereas renal clearance was driven by fraction unbound in plasma at high doses. Simulations demonstrated the importance of Michaelis-Menten parameter estimates (especially V (max)) for determining CL(r). K (m) estimates can easily be obtained directly from in vitro studies.
