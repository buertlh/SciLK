Female Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to a HF (42% energy as fat) or a standard (SD) diet for 6 weeks before being either ovariectomized (Ovx) or sham operated (Sham). Thereafter, Ovx and Sham rats were kept on the same diet for another 6 weeks leading to euthanasia. Liver TAG content was increased (p<0.01) in Ovx rats but not by the HF diet alone. However, the combination of HF diet and Ovx resulted in a greater liver TAG accumulation (p<0.06) than that observed in Ovx-SD/SD. Measurement of molecular markers of liver lipid metabolism revealed an increase in transcripts of markers of lipid oxidation (CPT-1 and PGC1; p<0.05) in rats fed the HF diet. This increase was, however, substantially less if HF fed rats were Ovx. Liver total cholesterol levels were increased (p<0.01) only in the Ovx-HF/HF rats while plasma cholesterol levels were increased in Ovx-SD/SD and in SHAM-HF/HF and Ovx-HF/HF rats. Transcripts of molecular markers of cholesterol metabolism suggest that biliary acids synthesis (CYP7a-1) was reduced in Ovx-SD/SD and Sham-HF/HF rats and even more so in Ovx-HF/HF rats. It is concluded that the effects of a HF diet on liver TAG accumulation are especially observed in Ovx rats possibly through a reduction in hepatic lipid oxidation.

Here we investigated whether AhR plays a role in 17-AAG-mediated anticancer activity by functioning as a downstream target or by modulating its anticancer efficacy. AhR expression in lung AD cells was modulated by siRNA interference or overexpression. Tumor growth was determined with colony formation in vitro or in vivo. Anticancer activity of 17-AAG was determined by measuring cell viability, cell cycle distribution, and expression of cell cycle regulators. Proteins and mRNA levels were examined by immunoblotting and the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. In this study, AhR overexpression positively modulated growth of lung AD cells, at least partially, via RelA-dependent mechanisms. Although treatment with 17-AAG reduced AhR levels and AhR-regulated gene expression in lung AD cells, AhR expression increased anticancer activity of 17-AAG. In addition, 17-AAG treatment reduced cell viability, CDK2, CDK4, cyclin E, cyclin D1, and phosphorylated Rb levels in AhR-expressing lung AD cells. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), which is regulated by AhR, was shown to increase anticancer activity of 17-AAG in cells. Knockdown of NQO1 expression attenuated the reduction of cell cycle regulators by 17-AAG treatment in AhR overexpressed cells. We demonstrated that AhR protein not only functions as a downstream target of 17-AAG, but also enhances anticancer activity of 17-AAG in lung AD cells.", "anno": [[102, 103, true], [181, 182, true], [328, 329, true], [493, 494, true], [580, 581, true], [651, 652, true], [791, 792, true], [929, 930, true], [1060, 1061, true], [1218, 1219, true], [1367, 1368, true], [1495, 1496, true], [1622, 1623, true], [1774, 1775, true]]}, {"id": 23229539, "text": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is recognized as a complication after surgery in the elderly.

Impaired cognitive function was observed on days 1 and 3 after splenectomy, while an anesthesia-alone group showed no significant difference from the control.

Furthermore, the levels of proteins involved in the maintenance of brain iron homeostasis, including ferritin, transferrin receptor 1, and iron regulatory protein 2, were significantly different at postoperative days 1 and 3 in the hippocampus of splenectomized animals when compared with those of the control. The alterations in iron homeostasis were accompanied by intensified oxidative stress as measured by increases in the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, and a decrease in the levels of superoxide dismutase activity.

However, it is unclear precisely how SGs control apoptosis. This study found that SGs suppress the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this suppression is essential for inhibiting ROS-dependent apoptosis. This antioxidant activity of SGs is controlled by two SG components, GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10). G3BP1 elevates the steady-state ROS level by inhibiting the antioxidant activity of USP10.

Although the ZnO sulfidation reaction has been widely studied, little is known about the transformation at the crystal scale, its detailed mechanism and kinetics. A model ZnO material with well-determined characteristics (particle size and shape) has been synthesized to perform this study. Characterizations of sulfided samples (using XRD, TEM and electron diffraction) have shown the formation of oriented polycrystalline ZnS nanoparticles with a predominant hexagonal form (wurtzite phase). TEM observations also have evidenced an outward development of the ZnS phase, showing zinc and oxygen diffusion from the ZnO-ZnS internal interface to the surface of the ZnS particle. The kinetics of ZnO sulfidation by H(2)S has been investigated using isothermal and isobaric thermogravimetry. Kinetic tests have been performed that show that nucleation of ZnS is instantaneous compared to the growth process. A reaction mechanism composed of eight elementary steps has been proposed to account for these results, and various possible rate laws have been determined upon approximation of the rate-determining step. Thermogravimetry experiments performed in a wide range of H(2)S and H(2)O partial pressures have shown that the ZnO sulfidation reaction rate has a nonlinear variation with H(2)S partial pressure at the same time no significant influence of water vapor on reaction kinetics has been observed. From these observations, a mixed kinetics of external interface reaction with water desorption and oxygen diffusion has been determined to control the reaction kinetics and the proposed mechanism has been validated. However, the formation of voids at the ZnO-ZnS internal interface, characterized by TEM and electron tomography, strongly slows down the reaction rate. Therefore, the impact of the decreasing ZnO-ZnS internal interface on reaction kinetics has been taken into account in the reaction rate expression. In this way the void formation at the interface has been modeled considering a random nucleation followed by an isotropic growth of cavities. Very good agreement has been observed between both experimental and calculated rates after taking into account the decrease in the ZnO-ZnS internal interface.", "anno": [[130, 131, true], [293, 294, true], [421, 422, true], [624, 625, true], [808, 809, true], [919, 920, true], [1035, 1036, true], [1240, 1241, true], [1533, 1534, true], [1749, 1750, true], [1901, 1902, true], [2050, 2051, true], [2192, 2193, true], [2351, 2352, true]]}, {"id": 23238425, "text": "Solutions of Nafion\u00ae with an ion exchange capacity (IEC) of 0.91 meq g(-1), which are on the verge of the formation of SO(3)H nanoclusters, were spin coated on silicon (Si), glassy carbon (GC) and platinum/silicon (Pt/Si) substrates to form films of up to 256 nm thickness.

Because these mismatches are closer to the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments than are mismatches made by Pol \u03b4 or Pol \u025b, the results not only support the previous suggestion that Exo1 preferentially excises lagging strand replication errors during mismatch repair, they further imply that the 5' ends serve as entry points for 5' excision of replication errors made by Pol \u03b1, and possibly as strand discrimination signals for MMR. Nonetheless, mutation rates in the Pol \u03b1 mutator strain are 5- to 25-fold lower in an exo1\u0394 strain as compared to an msh2\u0394 strain completely lacking MMR, indicating that in the absence of Exo1, most replication errors made by Pol \u03b1 can still be removed in an Msh2-dependent manner by other nucleases and/or by strand displacement.", "anno": [[132, 133, true], [437, 438, true], [714, 715, true], [971, 972, true], [1397, 1398, true], [1728, 1729, true]]}, {"id": 23245697, "text": "In both budding and fission yeast, a large number of ribonucleotides are incorporated into DNA during replication by the major replicative polymerases (Pols \u03b1, \u03b4 and \u025b).
