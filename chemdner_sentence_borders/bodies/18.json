Although adverse effects on neurodevelopment, including tremors and memory deficits, have been documented in experimental studies conducted with rodents exposed during the gestational and neonatal periods, no study has been conducted yet to determine if chlordecone alters child development. This study examines the relation of gestational and postnatal exposure to chlordecone to infant development at 18 months of age in a birth-cohort of Guadeloupean children. In a prospective longitudinal study conducted in Guadeloupe (Timoun mother-child cohort study), exposure to chlordecone was measured at birth from an umbilical cord blood sample (n=141) and from a breast milk sample collected at 3 months postpartum (n=75). Toddlers were assessed using an adapted version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. Higher chlordecone concentrations in cord blood were associated with poorer fine motor scores. When analyses were conducted separately for boys and girls, this effect was only observed among boys. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to chlordecone is associated with specific impairments in fine motor function in boys, and add to the growing evidence that exposure to organochlorine pesticides early in life impairs child development.", "anno": [[146, 147, true], [254, 255, true], [546, 547, true], [718, 719, true], [975, 976, true], [1061, 1062, true], [1156, 1157, true], [1258, 1259, true], [1506, 1507, true]]}, {"id": 23376110, "text": "The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylide derived in situ from the reaction of acenaphthylene-1,2-dione and 1,3-thiazolane-4-carboxylic acid to various exocyclic dipolarophiles synthesized from trans-androsterone and trans-dehydroandrosterone afforded a library of novel spiro[5'.2\u2033]acenaphthylene-1\u2033-one-spiro[16.6']-(7'-aryl)-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolo [1,2-c][1,3]thiazolo-trans-androsterone/dehydroandrosterone hybrid heterocycles respectively.

The present study found that intrathecal application of broad-spectrum PTPs inhibitors orthovanadate or Bpv (phen) generated little effects on the paw withdrawal thresholds of intact rats to Von Frey filament stimuli. Although the basal nociceptive responses didn't require the involvement of PTPs, the mechanical allodynia evoked by intrathecal injection of NMDA was greatly attenuated by orthovanadate and Bpv (phen), suggesting that PTPs activity, once stimulated by NMDA receptors, became essential for spinal sensitization. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that PTPs functioned to activate SFKs member Src and promote Src interaction with NR2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors (NR2B receptors). As a result, PTPs inhibition largely suppressed Src-mediated NR2B phosphorylation at Tyr1472 and reduced the synaptic concentration of NR2B receptors in spinal dorsal horn of NMDA-treated rats.

Structural characterizations include ab initio approaches from SAXS data alone, and when combined with previously determined crystal/NMR, atomistic modeling can further enhance structural solutions and assess validity. This combination can provide definitions of architectures, spatial organizations of protein domains within a complex, including those not determined by crystallography or NMR, as well as defining key conformational states of a protein interaction. SAXS is not generally constrained by macromolecule size, and the rapid collection of data in a 96-well plate format provides methods to screen sample conditions. This includes screening for co-factors, substrates, differing protein or nucleotide partners or small molecule inhibitors, to more fully characterize the variations within assembly states and key conformational changes. Such analyses may be useful for screening constructs and conditions to determine those most likely to promote crystal growth of a complex under study.

To evaluate potential DMA(III)-induced urothelial effects, it was administered to As3mt knockout mice which cannot methylate arsenicals. Female C57BL/6 wild type and As3mt knockout mice (10/group) were administered DMA(III), 77.3ppm in water for four weeks. Urothelial effects were evaluated by light and scanning electron microscopy (EM) and immunohistochemical detection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. EM findings were rated 1-5, with higher rating indicating greater extent of cytotoxicity visualized. DMA(III) significantly increased the BrdU labeling index, a ratio of BrdU labeled cells to non-labeled cells, in the treated knockout group compared to control and wild type treated groups. DMA(III) induced simple hyperplasia in more knockout mice (4/10) compared to wild type mice (2/10). All treated knockout mice had more and larger intracytoplasmic granules compared to the treated wild type mice. Changes in EM classification were not significant. In conclusion, DMA(III) induces urothelial toxicity and regenerative hyperplasia in mice and most likely plays a role in inorganic arsenic-induced urothelial changes. However, DMA(V) does not induce hyperplasia in mice, suggesting that urinary concentrations of DMA(III) do not reach cytotoxic levels in DMA(V)-treated mice.", "anno": [[88, 89, true], [160, 161, true], [288, 289, true], [448, 449, true], [585, 586, true], [706, 707, true], [864, 865, true], [965, 966, true], [1155, 1156, true], [1255, 1256, true], [1367, 1368, true], [1418, 1419, true], [1585, 1586, true], [1743, 1744, true]]}, {"id": 23376997, "text": "Aggrecanases, in particular aggrecanase-2 (ADAMTS-5), are considered the principal proteases responsible for aggrecan degradation in osteoarthritis.

When recording the interfacial pressure versus area isotherms of a PS-b-Dextran monolayer, time-dependent hysteresis was observed upon compression and expansion. We argue that this is due to (quasi-) 2D aggregation of the copolymer at the air-water surface, with three contributions. First, at large area per molecule, a zero surface pressure is measured; we ascribe this to self-assembly of block copolymers into surface micelles. At intermediate area we identify a second regime (\"desorption regime\") where aggregation into large patches occurs due to van der Waals attraction between PS blocks. At high surface pressure (\"brush regime\") we observe hysteretic behavior attributed to H-bonding between dextran chains.

This is achieved by a detailed investigation of a wide range of polystyrene-poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (PS-P4VP) block copolymers, in contrast to much more limited ranges in previous studies. Parameters that are varied include the block ratios (mainly for similar total molecular weights, occasionally other total molecular weights), the presence or not of 3-n-pentadecylphenol (PDP, usually equimolar with VP, with which it hydrogen bonds), the spreading solution concentration (\"low\" and \"high\"), and the LB technique (standard vs \"solvent-assisted\"). Our observations are compared with previously published results on other amphiphilic diblock copolymers, which had given rise to contradictory interpretations of morphology formation. Based on the accumulated results, we re-establish early literature conclusions that three main categories of LB block copolymer morphologies are obtained depending on the block ratio, termed planar, strand, and dot regimes. The block composition boundaries in terms of mol % block content are shown to be similar for all BCs having alkyl chain substituents on the hydrophilic block (such as PS-P4VP/PDP) and are shifted to higher values for BCs with no alkyl chain substituents (such as PS-P4VP). This is attributed to the higher surface area per repeat unit of the hydrophilic block monolayer on the water surface for the former, as supported by the onset and limiting areas of the Langmuir isotherms for the BCs in the dot regime. 2D phase diagrams are discussed in terms of relative effective surface areas of the two blocks. We identify and discuss how kinetic effects on morphology formation, which have been highlighted in more recent literature, are superposed on the compositional effects. The kinetic effects are shown to depend on the morphology regime, most strongly influencing the strand and, especially, planar regimes, where they give rise to a diversity of specific structures. Besides film dewetting mechanisms, which are different when occurring in structured versus unstructured films (the latter previously discussed in the literature), kinetic influences are discussed in terms of chain association dynamics leading to depletion effects that impact on growing aggregates. These depletion effects particularly manifest themselves in more dilute spreading solutions, with higher molecular weight polymers, and in composition regimes characterized by equilibrium degrees of aggregation that are effectively infinite.

It was previously demonstrated that an in vitro assay that profiles ligand-induced binding of ER\u03b1 to a microarray of coregulator-derived peptides might be a valuable candidate for a panel of in vitro assays aiming at an ultimate replacement of the uterotrophic assay. In the present study, the reproducibility and robustness of this coregulator binding assay was determined by measuring the binding profiles of 14 model compounds that are recommended by the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances for testing laboratory proficiency in estrogen receptor transactivation assays. With a median coefficient of variation of 5.0% and excellent correlation (R(2) = 0.993) between duplicate measurements, the reproducibility of the ER\u03b1-coregulator binding assay was better than the reproducibility of other commonly used in vitro ER functional assays. In addition, the coregulator binding assay is correctly predicting the estrogenicity for 13 out of 14 compounds tested. When the potency of the ER-agonists to induce ER\u03b1-coregulator binding was compared to their ER binding affinity, their ranking was similar, and the correlation between the EC50 values was excellent (R(2) = 0.96), as was the correlation with their potency in a transactivation assay (R(2) = 0.94).

In the present study, the possible role of conversion of accumulated ammonia to glutamine and other free amino acids in the brain of three freshwater teleosts differing in their sensitivities to ammonia was investigated. The detoxification mode of ammonia in brain is suggested to be through amination of glutamate to glutamine by the coupled activities of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), transaminase (aspartate aminotransaminase 'AST' and alanine aminotransaminase 'ALT') and glutamine synthetase (GSase). We investigated the metabolic response of amino acids in the brain of highly sensitive salmonid Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout), the less sensitive cyprinid Cyprinus carpio (common carp) and the highly resistant cyprinid Carassius auratus (goldfish) when exposed to 1mM ammonia (as NH4HCO3; pH 7.9) for 0 h (control), 3 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 84 h and 180 h. Results show that HEA exposure increased ammonia accumulation significantly in the brain of all the three species from 12h onwards.

In trout, glutamine levels also increased (84-180 h) but GSase was not activated. The elevated glutamine level in trout was accompanied by a significant depletion of the glutamate pool in contrast to the stable glutamate levels seen in carp and goldfish. This suggests a simultaneous increase in the rate of glutamate formation to match with the demand of glutamine formation in cyprinids. The activity of GDH was elevated significantly in carp and goldfish but remained unaltered in trout. Also, the transaminase enzymes (AST and ALT) were elevated significantly in exposed carp and goldfish while only ALT was up-regulated in trout. Consequently, in carp and goldfish both aspartate and alanine were utilized under HEA, whereas only alanine was consumed in trout.

Based on the properties of the inverted motility geometry, the total size of these nanofluidic networks was limited by MT surface density, molecular motor energy source (ATP), and total amount and physical properties of lipid source material. Interactions between MTs and extended lipid nanotubes resulted in bifurcation of the nanotubes and ultimately the generation of highly branched networks of fluidically connected nanotubes. The network bifurcation was easily tuned by changing the density of microtubules on the surface to increase or decrease the frequency of branching.

Using biotin-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugates (biotin-FITC) as delivery agents and guinea pig animal models, we showed that MB ultrasound exposure can improve the inner ear system use of biotin-FITC delivery via the RWM by approximately 3.5 to 38 times that of solely soaking biotin-FITC around the RWM for spontaneous diffusion. We also showed that there was significant enhancement of hair cell uptake of gentamicin in animals whose tympanic bullas were soaked with MB-mixed gentamicin-Texas Red or gentamicin and exposed to ultrasound. Furthermore, increased permeability of the RWM from acoustic cavitation of MBs could also be visualized immediately following ultrasound exposure by using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin as a tracer.

To enhance intra-cellular transduction efficiency, Tat sequence as a protein transduction domain (PTD) was fused with MT in a recombinant method. Anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effects of Tat-MT fusion protein were evaluated under hyperglycemia and hypoxia stress conditions in cultured H9c2 cells. Recovery of cardiac functions by anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic effects of Tat-MT was confirmed in an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) rat myocardial infarction model. Tat-MT fusion protein effectively protected H9c2 cells under stressful conditions by reducing intracellular ROS production and inhibiting caspase-3 activation.

In this study we have conducted a comparative analysis of the toxicity of perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCA) with a carbon chain length ranging from four to twelve carbon atoms. By using the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 as an in vitro model for human hepatocytes we could show a positive correlation between the carbon chain length of the respective PFCA and its cytotoxicity. There was, however, no indication of an apoptotic mechanism for cytotoxicity. All PFCA under investigation were negative in two independent genotoxicity assays. As PFOA, being a well-known peroxisome proliferator, the other PFCA tested in this study were also shown to activate human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) with PFOA having the highest potential of PPAR\u03b1 activation.

A newly established hESC line was directionally differentiated into mammary epithelial cells by a well-established three-dimensional (3D) culture system. The differentiated mammary epithelial cells were characterized by immunofluorescence and western blotting assay, and were called induced differentiated mammary epithelial cells (iDMECs) based on these data.

Our results showed that low dose BPA and E2 could influence the mammosphere area of iDMECs and upregulate the expression level of Oct4 and Nanog proteins, while only BPA could downregulate the expression of E-cadherin protein.
