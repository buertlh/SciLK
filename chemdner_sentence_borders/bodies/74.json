Error-free DNA synthesis involves 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation to base pair with cytosine whereas mutagenic bypass involves 8-oxoG adopting a syn-conformation to base pair with adenine. Left unrepaired the syn-8-oxoG/dAMP base pair results in a G-C to T-A transversion. During base excision repair of this mispair, DNA polymerase (pol) \u03b2 is confronted with gap filling opposite 8-oxoG. To determine how pol \u03b2 discriminates between anti- and syn-8-oxoG, we introduced a point mutation (R283K) to alter insertion specificity. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this substitution results in an increased fidelity opposite 8-oxoG. Structural studies with R283K pol \u03b2 show that the binary DNA complex has 8-oxoG in equilibrium between anti- and syn-forms. Ternary complexes with incoming dCTP resemble the wild-type enzyme, with templating anti-8-oxoG base pairing with incoming cytosine. In contrast to wild-type pol \u03b2, the ternary complex of the R283K mutant with an incoming dATP-analogue and templating 8-oxoG resembles a G-A mismatched structure with 8-oxoG adopting an anti-conformation. These results demonstrate that the incoming nucleotide is unable to induce a syn-8-oxoG conformation without minor groove DNA polymerase interactions that influence templating (anti-/syn-equilibrium) of 8-oxoG while modulating fidelity.", "anno": [[135, 136, true], [329, 330, true], [413, 414, true], [529, 530, true], [667, 668, true], [768, 769, true], [892, 893, true], [1025, 1026, true], [1230, 1231, true], [1467, 1468, true]]}, {"id": 23589542, "text": "OBJECTIVE To review the evidence about the impact of hypoglycemia on patients with diabetes that has become available since the past reviews of this subject by the American Diabetes Association and The Endocrine Society and to provide guidance about how this new information should be incorporated into clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS Five members of the American Diabetes Association and five members of The Endocrine Society with expertise in different aspects of hypoglycemia were invited by the Chair, who is a member of both, to participate in a planning conference call and a 2-day meeting that was also attended by staff from both organizations. Subsequent communications took place via e-mail and phone calls. The writing group consisted of those invitees who participated in the writing of the manuscript. The workgroup meeting was supported by educational grants to the American Diabetes Association from Lilly USA, LLC and Novo Nordisk and sponsorship to the American Diabetes Association from Sanofi. The sponsors had no input into the development of or content of the report. EVIDENCE The writing group considered data from recent clinical trials and other studies to update the prior workgroup report. Unpublished data were not used. Expert opinion was used to develop some conclusions. CONSENSUS PROCESS Consensus was achieved by group discussion during conference calls and face-to-face meetings, as well as by iterative revisions of the written document. The document was reviewed and approved by the American Diabetes Association's Professional Practice Committee in October 2012 and approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors in November 2012 and was reviewed and approved by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Affairs Core Committee in October 2012 and by Council in November 2012. CONCLUSIONS The workgroup reconfirmed the previous definitions of hypoglycemia in diabetes, reviewed the implications of hypoglycemia on both short- and long-term outcomes, considered the implications of hypoglycemia on treatment outcomes, presented strategies to prevent hypoglycemia, and identified knowledge gaps that should be addressed by future research.

Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor (kit(W/W-v)) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to the development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kit(W/W-v) mice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the in kit(W/W-v) mice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow adipocytes were not detected in either intact or ovx kit(W/W-v) mice. However, ovx in WT and kit(W/W-v) mice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters.

The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of different organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the beta-cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action (American Diabetes Association, 2011). The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad categories. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion, whereas in type 2 diabetes (T2D), the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. However, the subdivision into two main categories represents a simplification of the real situation, and research during the recent years has shown that the disease is much more heterogeneous than a simple subdivision into two major subtypes assumes. Worldwide prevalence figures estimate that there are 280 million diabetic patients in 2011 and more than 500 million in 2030 (http://www.diabetesatlas.org/). In Europe, about 6-8% of the population suffer from diabetes, of them about 90% has T2D and 10% T1D, thereby making T2D to the fastest increasing disease in Europe and worldwide. This epidemic has been ascribed to a collision between the genes and the environment. While our knowledge about the genes is clearly better for T1D than for T2D given the strong contribution of variation in the HLA region to the risk of T1D, the opposite is the case for T2D, where our knowledge about the environmental triggers (obesity, lack of exercise) is much better than the understanding of the underlying genetic causes. This lack of knowledge about the underlying genetic causes of diabetes is often referred to as missing heritability (Manolio et al., 2009) which exceeds 80% for T2D but less than 25% for T1D. In the following review, we will discuss potential sources of this missing heritability which also includes the possibility that our definition of diabetes and its subgroups is imprecise and thereby making the identification of genetic causes difficult.", "anno": [[141, 142, true], [326, 327, true], [400, 401, true], [609, 610, true], [680, 681, true], [916, 917, true], [1167, 1168, true], [1325, 1326, true], [1504, 1505, true], [1590, 1591, true], [1933, 1934, true], [2125, 2126, true], [2379, 2380, true]]}, {"id": 23252952, "text": "Clinical trial samples collected for pharmacogenomic and future research are vital resources for the development of safe and effective drugs, yet collecting adequate, representative sample sets in global trials is challenging.

Upon reaching water bodies, ES can cause negative effects on aquatic animals, including disruption of hormonal systems. However, the action of ES on fish reproductive axis has been hardly studied thus far. The aim of the present work was to assess the endocrine disruptive potential of endosulfan on the pituitary gonadotropins levels and on the testes function due to ES in the South American freshwater fish Cichlasoma dimerus, using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In vitro experiments showed that ES inhibited the LH-stimulated steroidogenesis in gonads; no change was observed in gonadotropins release from pituitaries in culture. Laboratory waterborne ES (0.1, 0.3 and 1 \u03bcg/L) exposure for two months caused decrease in \u03b2FSH pituitary content and \u03b3GT activity in the testes (Sertoli cell function marker). Testicular histology revealed pathologies such as scarce intermediate stages of spermatogenesis, release of immature germ cells into the lobular lumen, presence of foam cells and interstitial fibrosis. As FSH and FSH-mediated steroidogenesis regulate spermatogenesis and Sertoli cell function, the effect of ES on FSH could be responsible for the morphological alterations observed in testes.

Analyses of 5XFAD hemi-brain samples indicated that L803-mts restored the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibited autophagy. Lysosomal acidification was impaired in the 5XFAD brains as indicated by reduced cathepsin D activity and decreased N-glycoyslation of the vacuolar ATPase subunit V0a1, a modification required for lysosomal acidification.

Memory disturbances described in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients are believed to be associated with changes in neuronal activity, in particular at the level of the hippocampus. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims at investigating whether the effects of SSR125543 (10\u00a0mg/kg/day for 2\u00a0weeks) on cognitive impairment induced by traumatic stress exposure are associated with changes in hippocampal excitability. Effects of SSR125543 were compared to those of the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, paroxetine (10\u00a0mg/kg/day), and the partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist, D-cycloserine (10\u00a0mg/kg/day), two compounds which have demonstrated clinical efficacy against PTSD. METHODS: Mice received two unavoidable electric foot-shocks. Then, 1 or 16\u00a0days after stress, they were tested for their memory performance using the object recognition test. Neuronal excitability was recorded during the third week post-stress in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Drugs were administered from day 1 post-stress to the day preceding the electrophysiological study. RESULTS: Application of electric shocks produced cognitive impairment 16, but not 1\u00a0day after stress, an effect which was associated with a decrease in hippocampal neuronal excitability. Both stress-induced effects were prevented by repeated administration of SSR125543, paroxetine and D-cycloserine.

The distribution of 10,439 PCa foci was analyzed and visualized on a heat map. The color gradient of the heat map was reduced to six colors representing the frequency classification of the relative frequency of PCa using an image posterization effect. We defined 22 regions in the prostate according to the frequency of PCa occurrence. Seven hundred ninety RPSs containing 6,374 PCa foci and 4,502 HGPIN foci were evaluated. The topographical association between PCa and HGPIN in the RPSs was analyzed by estimating the frequencies of PCa and HGPIN in 22 regions. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the odds ratios of HGPIN for the presence of PCa in 22 regions. RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of PCa specimens included HGPIN and had significantly more favorable Gleason scores, lower PSA levels and smaller relative tumor volumes than isolated PCa specimens. HGPIN (68%) and PCa (69%) were predominantly localized to the apical half of the prostate. HGPIN was mainly concentrated in the peripheral zone medial to regions with high PCa frequencies. Upon logistic regression analysis, HGPIN was a significant predictor of PCa co-existence in 11 regions. CONCLUSIONS: HGPIN was located adjacent to PCa in whole RPSs.

Altered levels of lipids and enzymatic antioxidants were also restored by the SDG to the considerable levels in diabetic rats. Results of the present investigation suggest that diabetes is associated with an increase in oxidative stress as shown by increase in serum malondialdehyde (MDA), decreased levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH).

Calculations performed for several properties in divers systems show that the method is robust with various choices of the frozen orbitals and frontier atom properties. With appropriate basis set assignment, it gives results equivalent with those of a related approach [G. G. Ferenczy previous paper in this issue] using the Huzinaga equation. Thus, the local basis equation can be used in mixed QM/MM methods with small size quantum subsystems to calculate properties in good agreement with reference Hartree-Fock-Roothaan results. It is shown that bond charges are not necessary when the local basis equation is applied, although they are required for the self-consistent field solution of the Huzinaga equation based method. Conversely, the deformation of the wave-function near to the boundary is observed without bond charges and this has a significant effect on deprotonation energies but a less pronounced effect when the total charge of the system is conserved.

Other pesticides, like diuron, did not alter reporter gene expression detectably even at the highest test concentration attainable, while others (such as glyphosate) did so only at very high concentrations. We have also used five responsive GFP reporters to investigate the toxicity of soil pore water from two agricultural sites in south-east Spain, designated P74 (used for cauliflower production, but significantly metal contaminated) and P73 (used for growing lettuce, but with only background levels of metals). Both soil pore water samples induced all five test genes to varying extents, yet artificial mixtures containing all major metals present had essentially no effect on these same transgenes. Soluble organic contaminants present in the pore water were extracted with acetone and dichloromethane, then after evaporation of the solvents, the organic residues were redissolved in ultrapure water to reconstitute the soluble organic components of the original soil pore water. These organic extracts induced transgene expression at similar or higher levels than the original pore water. Addition of the corresponding metal mixtures had either no effect, or reduced transgene expression towards the levels seen with soil pore water only. We conclude that the main toxicants present in these soil pore water samples are organic rather than metallic in nature.

GRE contained higher levels of all compounds, except the enolic phenylpyruvic acid-2-O-glucoside and luteolin-7-O-glucoside. Both rooibos extracts increased glucose uptake, mitochondrial activity and ATP production. Compared to FRE, GRE was more effective at increasing glucose uptake and ATP production.

METHODS: The locomotor-stimulant effects of ABT-288 were measured in mice and rats, and potential development of sensitization was addressed. Drug discrimination was used to assess amphetamine-like stimulus properties, and drug self-administration was used to evaluate reinforcing effects of ABT-288. The potential development of physical dependence was also studied. RESULTS: ABT-288 lacked locomotor-stimulant effects in both rats and mice. Repeated administration of ABT-288 did not result in cross-sensitization to the stimulant effects of d-amphetamine in mice, suggesting that there is little overlap in circuitries upon which the two drugs interact for motor activity.

We investigated effects of subchronic treatment with the NMDA antagonist memantine by using behavioural observation and multimodal MRI. METHODS: Pharmacological MRI (phMRI) was used to map the neuroanatomical binding sites of memantine after acute and subchronic treatment. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI were used to study the changes in functional connectivity (FC) and ultra-structural tissue integrity before and after subchronic memantine treatment. Further corroborating behavioural evidences were documented. RESULTS: Dose-dependent phMRI activation was observed in the prelimbic cortex following acute doses of memantine. Subchronic treatment revealed significant effects in the hippocampus, cingulate, prelimbic and retrosplenial cortices. Decreases in FC amongst the hippocampal and frontal cortical structures (prelimbic, cingulate) were apparent through rs-fMRI investigation, indicating a loss of connectivity. Diffusion kurtosis MRI showed decreases in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity changes, suggesting ultra-structural changes in the hippocampus and cingulate cortex. Limited behavioural assessment suggested that memantine induced behavioural effects comparable to other NMDA antagonists as measured by locomotor hyperactivity and that the effects could be reversed by antipsychotic drugs. CONCLUSION: Our findings substantiate the hypothesis that repeated NMDA receptor blockade with nonspecific, noncompetitive NMDA antagonists may lead to functional and ultra-structural alterations, particularly in the hippocampus and cingulate cortex.

Furthermore, the present findings underscore the utility and the translational potential of multimodal MR imaging and acute/subchronic memantine model in the search for novel disease-modifying treatments for schizophrenia.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [126, 127, true], [262, 263, true], [271, 272, true], [400, 401, true], [597, 598, true], [658, 659, true], [667, 668, true], [772, 773, true], [891, 892, true], [1066, 1067, true], [1238, 1239, true], [1461, 1462, true], [1473, 1474, true], [1712, 1713, true], [1764, 1765, true], [1987, 1988, true]]}, {"id": 23274058, "text": "Jaceosidin, a flavonoid derived from Artemisia princeps (Japanese mugwort), has been shown to inhibit the growth of several human cancer cells, However, the exact mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of jaceosidin is not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the antiproliferative effect of jaceosidin in human endometrial cancer cells. We demonstrated that jaceosidin is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than cisplatin in human endometrial cancer cells. In contrast, jaceosidin-induced cytotoxicity in normal endometrial cells was lower than that observed for cisplatin. Jaceosidin induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and modulated the levels of cyclin B and p-Cdc2 in Hec1A cells. Knockdown of p21 using specific siRNAs partially abrogated jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that jaceosidin treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Cdc25C and ATM-Chk1/2. Ku55933, an ATM inhibitor, reversed jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition, in part. Moreover, jaceosidin treatment resulted in phosphorylation of ERK, and pretreatment with the ERK inhibitor, PD98059, attenuated cell growth inhibition by jaceosidin. These data suggest that jaceosidin, isolated from Japanese mugwort, modulates the ERK/ATM/Chk1/2 pathway, leading to inactivation of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex, followed by G2/M cell cycle arrest in endometrial cancer cells.", "anno": [[142, 143, true], [240, 241, true], [385, 386, true], [509, 510, true], [626, 627, true], [738, 739, true], [840, 841, true], [975, 976, true], [1063, 1064, true], [1229, 1230, true], [1454, 1455, true]]}, {"id": 23246353, "text": "To shed light on islet cell molecular phenotype in human type 2 diabetes (T2D), we studied the transcriptome of non-diabetic (ND) and T2D islets to then focus on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the major protein degradation pathway. We assessed gene expression, amount of ubiquitinated proteins, proteasome activity, and the effects of proteasome inhibition and prolonged exposure to palmitate. Microarray analysis identified more than one thousand genes differently expressed in T2D islets, involved in many structures and functions, with consistent alterations of the UPS. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated downregulation of selected UPS genes in T2D islets and beta cell fractions, with greater ubiquitin accumulation and reduced proteasome activity. Chemically induced reduction of proteasome activity was associated with lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which was partly reproduced by palmitate exposure.

The morphological changes were photographed based on staining lipid accumulation by Oil-Red O in RGZ (1 \u00b5mol/l)-treated 3T3-L1 cells without or with various concentrations of 6-gingerol on differentiation day 8. Quantitation of triglycerides content was performed in cells on day 8 after differentiation induction. Differentiated cells were lysed to detect mRNA and protein levels of adipocyte-specific transcription factors by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. 6-gingerol (50 \u00b5mol/l) effectively suppressed oil droplet accumulation and reduced the sizes of the droplets in RGZ-induced adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. The triglyceride accumulation induced by RGZ in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells was also reduced by 6-gingerol (50 \u00b5mol/l). Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells with 6-gingerol (50 \u00b5mol/l) antagonized RGZ-induced gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1. Additionally, the increased levels of mRNA and protein in adipocyte-specific fatty acid binding protein 4 and fatty acid synthase induced by RGZ in 3T3-L1 cells were decreased upon treatment with 6-gingerol.

The \"oddball\" P3 ERP was recorded as well. Users and controls did not differ on the amplitude or latency of the ERN; however, Pe amplitude was larger among users. Users also showed increased amplitude and reduced latency of the P3 in response to infrequent stimuli presented during the task. Among users, urinary cannabinoid metabolite levels at testing were unrelated to ERP outcomes. However, total years of cannabis use correlated negatively with P3 latency and positively with P3 amplitude, and age of first cannabis use correlated negatively with P3 amplitude. The results of this study suggest that chronic cannabis use is associated with alterations in neural activity related to the processing of motivationally-relevant stimuli (P3) and errors (Pe).", "anno": [[102, 103, true], [243, 244, true], [368, 369, true], [636, 637, true], [679, 680, true], [799, 800, true], [928, 929, true], [1022, 1023, true], [1202, 1203, true], [1395, 1396, true]]}, {"id": 22921427, "text": "Drug toxicity may occur due to dangerous drug combination. We aimed to investigate the influence of verapamil (a P-gp inhibitor)--bufadienolides interaction on cardiotoxicity and bufadienolide uptake by the isolated heart. The study was performed in Langendorff isolated perfused guinea-pig hearts by bufadienolides infusion in the absence and presence of verapamil (250, 500ng/ml). Arrhythmia parameters were evaluated by ECG and the content of bufadienolides in heart were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). In the present of verapamil, the wide QRS duration and lightly rapid heart rate (HR) were markedly reduced in the early stage of bufadienolide intoxication. However, the ECG changes characterized by prolonged P-R interval, and slow heart rate and low QRS amplitude in the late stage of bufadienolide intoxication were significantly enhanced. Furthermore, the contents of a variety of bufadienolide compounds in the verapamil+bufadienolide group were significantly higher when cardiac arrest occurred. Although verapamil reduced the bufadienolide-induced ventricular arrhythmias, verapamil worsened heart block and lethal bradycardia of bufadienolides partly via increasing the uptake of bufadienolides in heart tissue, which could compromise the protective effects of verapamil against bufadienolide intoxication.

Drug solubilization was enhanced by incorporation within the hydrophobic micellar core which was confirmed by solubility study and UV spectra. Spherical core-shell micelles were obtained with a particle size below 100nm and zeta potential around -30mV. At low drug loading, FLT was totally incorporated within micellar core as revealed by thermal analysis. However, at higher loading, excess non-incorporated drug at micelle surface caused a significant reduction in the surface charge density. Turbidity measurements demonstrated the high physical stability of micelles for 2weeks dependent on GNP-crosslinking degree. In a dry powdered form, the micelles were stable for 6months with no significant changes in drug content or particle size. A sustained drug release from CAS micelles up to 5days was observed.
