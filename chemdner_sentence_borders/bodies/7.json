The aim of this study was to investigate the positive feedback effect of progesterone during the immediate period following ovariectomy. Experiments were performed in 12 normally cycling women (aged 39-49 years). Following abdominal hysterectomy plus bilateral ovariectomy performed on cycle day 3 (day 0), the women received either estradiol via skin patches (days 0-7, n = 6, group 1) or estradiol as above plus vaginal progesterone (days 1-7, n = 6, group 2). Serum estradiol values increased similarly in the two groups. After the operation, serum progesterone levels decreased significantly in group 1, while in group 2 they remained stable becoming higher than in group 1 (p < 0.05). An LH and an FSH surge occurred in group 2 with the values after the peak returning to the pre-surge baseline. In contrast, in group 1 LH and FSH levels following an initial decrease, increased gradually until the end of the experiment. These results demonstrate that, despite a variable response to estrogens, the positive feedback effect of progesterone remained intact immediately after ovariectomy in women. It is suggested that it is the combining action of estradiol and progesterone that can ensure the expression of a positive feedback mechanism in women.", "anno": [[142, 143, true], [279, 280, true], [355, 356, true], [605, 606, true], [667, 668, true], [832, 833, true], [943, 944, true], [1069, 1070, true], [1244, 1245, true], [1396, 1397, true]]}, {"id": 23153054, "text": "1.

Hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLint,h) of six CYP3A4 substrates (alprazolam, clonazepam, diltiazem, midazolam, nifedipine, and quinidine), covering a wide range of clearance, in monkeys correlated well with that cited in literature for humans (R = 0.90) with a simple equation of Y = 0.165X (Y: human CLint,h, X: monkey CLint,h, represented in mL/min/kg). 3. To verify the predictability of human CLint,h, monkey CLint,h of a test set of CYP3A4 substrates cited in literature (dexamethasone, nifedipine, midazolam, quinidine, tacrolimus, and verapamil) was applied to the equation and human CLint,h was calculated. The human CLint,h of all the substrates was predicted within 3-fold error (fold error: 0.35-2.77). 4. The predictability of human CLh by our method was superior to common in vivo prediction methods (allometry and liver blood flow method).

To evaluate the long-term effects of RAI ablation on salivary gland function, we investigated scintigraphic changes in salivary glands by direct comparison of two salivary gland scintigraphies (SGSs) taken before and at 5 years after an RAI ablation. Methods: SGS was performed just before RAI ablation (pre-SGS) and \u223c5 years after RAI ablation (F/U SGS) in 213 subjects who underwent thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. The uptake score (U score) was graded, and the ejection fraction (EF) was quantified for the parotid and submandibular glands at pre-SGS and F/U SGS. Changes in salivary gland function were graded as mild, moderate, or severe according to the differences in U score and EF between the two SGSs. Xerostomia was assessed and compared with the SGS findings. Results: Worsening of the U score was observed in 182 of 852 salivary glands (total: 21.3%; mild: 4.2%, moderate: 7.4%, severe: 9.7%), and 47.4% of the patients had a worsening U score for at least one of four salivary glands.

Bilateral parotid gland dysfunction was the most commonly observed condition. Thirty-five (16.4%) patients complained of xerostomia at 5 years after RAI ablation. Scintigraphic changes in salivary gland function and xerostomia were more common in patients receiving 5.55\u2009GBq, compared with 3.7\u2009GBq.

The number of dysfunctional salivary glands was correlated with xerostomia (p<0.01). Conclusion: About 20% of the salivary glands were dysfunctional on SGS 5 years after a single RAI ablation, especially in patients who received higher doses of RAI.

In this review, the authors focus on i) oncogenic and anti-tumour acting miRNAs, ii) function of miRNAs in tumour progression, iii) possible role of miRNAs in resistance to anticancer drugs, and iv) diagnostic potential of miRNAs for identification of cancer from circulating miRNAs with special emphasis on prostate cancer.

In a recent fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) study monitoring ethanol-induced changes of the BOLD signal a reduction of the amplitude and a prolongation of the BOLD signal were observed. However, the BOLD signal is assumed to consist of a complex superposition of different underlying signals. To gain insight how ethanol influences stimulus efficacy, oxygen extraction, transit time and vessel-related parameters the fMRI time series from the sensori-motor and the visual cortex were analyzed using the balloon model. The results show a region-dependent decrease of the stimulus efficacy to trigger a post-stimulus neurovascular response as well as a prolongation of the transit time through the venous compartment. Oxygen extraction, feedback mechanisms and other vessel-related parameters were not affected. The results may be interpreted as follows: the overall mechanisms of the neurovascular coupling are still acting well at the moderate ethanol level of about 0.8\u2030 (in particular the vessel-related parts), but the potency to evoke a neurovascular response is already compromised most obviously in the supplementary motor area responsible for complex synchronizing and planning processes.", "anno": [[220, 221, true], [419, 420, true], [526, 527, true], [751, 752, true], [949, 950, true], [1043, 1044, true], [1429, 1430, true]]}, {"id": 23159331, "text": "Methamphetamine induces monoamine depletions thought to contribute to cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions.

Rats were pretreated with (\u00b1)-methamphetamine (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0mg/kg, 2-hr intervals) or saline. Three weeks later, rats were trained to press a lever on one side of an operant chamber and then retrieve the reinforcer from a magazine on the opposite side until they reached criterion (>50 reinforcers/30-min). After four consecutive sessions performing the task at criterion, rats were sacrificed and brains removed for monoamine determinations. Methamphetamine-pretreated rats had \u223c50% loss of striatal dopamine and prefrontal serotonin. Methamphetamine- and saline-pretreated rats were not different in the number of sessions required to reach criterion or in the total numbers of lever presses and/or head entries made across the four consecutive sessions at criterion-level performance. However, methamphetamine-pretreated rats earned fewer reinforcers, because they made extra lever-presses and head entries when they should have been retrieving the reinforcer or returning to the lever. Latencies for methamphetamine-pretreated rats to switch between the two behaviors also were significantly slower than latencies for controls. Interestingly, the degree of additional lever-presses negatively correlated with serotonin-transporter binding in the prefrontal cortex, even in saline-pretreated controls.

Here, we designed primers for amplifying 13 new exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) autosomal loci for studying shallow phylogeny and taxonomy of Laurasiatherian mammals. Three criteria were used for the selection of the markers: gene orthology, a PCR product length between 600 and 1200 nucleotides, and different chromosomal locations in the bovine genome. Positive PCRs were obtained from different species representing the orders Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, Chiroptera, Perissodactyla and Pholidota.

The phylogenetic results were compared to those obtained from analyses of the complete mitochondrial genome and Y chromosomal genes. Our analyses support a basal divergence of the saola (Pseudoryx) and a sister-group relationship between yak and bison. These results contrast with recent molecular studies but are in better agreement with morphology.

We established immunohistochemical methods to quantify the DNA damage markers poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX), 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), and 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) in paraffin-embedded tissue from particle-exposed rats. The study was based on lungs from a subchronic study that was part of an already published carcinogenicity study where rats had been intratracheally instilled with saline, quartz DQ12, amorphous silica (Aerosil(\u00ae) 150), or carbon black (Printex(\u00ae) 90) at monthly intervals for 3 months. Lung sections were stained immunohistochemically and markers were quantified in alveolar lining cells. Local genotoxicity was then correlated with already defined endpoints, i.e. mean inflammation score, bronchoalveolar lavage parameters, and carcinogenicity. Genotoxicity was most pronounced in quartz DQ12-treated rats, where all genotoxicity markers gave statistically significant positive results, indicating considerable genotoxic stress such as occurrence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and oxidative damage with subsequent repair activity. Genotoxicity was less pronounced for Printex(\u00ae) 90, but significant increases in \u03b3-H2AX- and 8-OH-dG-positive nuclei and OGG1-positive cytoplasm were nevertheless detected. In contrast, Aerosil(\u00ae) 150 significantly enhanced only 8-OH-dG-positive nuclei and oxidative damage-related repair activity (OGG1) in cytoplasm. In the present study, \u03b3-H2AX was the most sensitive genotoxicity marker, differentiating best between the three types of particles. The mean number of 8-OH-dG-positive nuclei, however, correlated best with the mean inflammation score at the same time point. This methodological approach enables integration of local genotoxicity testing in subchronic inhalation studies and makes immunohistochemical detection, in particular of \u03b3-H2AX and 8-hydroxyguanine, a very promising approach for local genotoxicity testing in lungs, with prognostic value for the long-term outcome of particle exposure.", "anno": [[196, 197, true], [454, 455, true], [741, 742, true], [844, 845, true], [1001, 1002, true], [1292, 1293, true], [1465, 1466, true], [1611, 1612, true], [1743, 1744, true], [1869, 1870, true], [2205, 2206, true]]}, {"id": 23178279, "text": "Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) concentrations and the ability of the GR to dimerize are factors which influence sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Upon glucocorticoid binding, the GR is actively transported into the nucleus, a crucial step in determining GR function. We examined the effects of GR concentration and the ability to dimerize on GR nuclear import, export and nuclear distribution using both live cell microscopy of GFP-tagged GR and immunofluorescence of untagged GR, with both wild type GR (GRwt) and dimerization deficient GR (GRdim). We found that the observed rate of GR nuclear import increases significantly at higher GR concentrations, at saturating concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-6) M) using GFP-tagged GR, while with untagged GR it is only discernable at sub-saturating ligand concentrations (10(-10)-10(-9) M). Loss of dimerization results in a slower observed rate of nuclear import (2.5- to 3.3-fold decrease for GFP-GRdim) as well as a decreased extent of GR nuclear localization (18-27% decrease for untagged GRdim). These results were linked to an increased rate of GR export at low GR concentrations (1.4- to 1.6-fold increase for untagged GR) and where GR dimerization is abrogated (1.5- to 1.7-fold increase for GFP-GRdim). Furthermore, GR dimerization was shown to be required for the appearance of discrete GC-dependent GR nuclear foci, the loss of which may explain the increased rate of GR export for the GRdim. The reduction in the observed rate of nuclear import and increased rate of nuclear export displayed at low GR concentrations and by the GRdim could explain the lowered glucocorticoid response under these conditions.", "anno": [[140, 141, true], [261, 262, true], [544, 545, true], [834, 835, true], [1044, 1045, true], [1255, 1256, true], [1447, 1448, true], [1663, 1664, true]]}, {"id": 23178339, "text": "This work aimed to develop solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) loaded with doxorubicin evaluating the influence of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid that enhances the activity of anticancer drugs, on drug encapsulation efficiency (EE).

The reduction in particle size (from 127 \u00b1 14 to 94 \u00b1 1 nm) and negative charges were obtained for SLN loaded with DHA and triethanolamine (TEA), amine used to increase the solubility of doxorubicin in melted lipid.

The doxorubicin release in a slightly acid medium (pH 5.0) was higher than that observed at physiological pH. The in vitro studies clearly showed the higher cytotoxicity of doxorubicin-DHA-loaded SLN than free doxorubicin+DHA on human lung tumor cell line (A549) and the improved cellular uptake achieved with the drug encapsulation can be an explanation.

Current therapies have focus on the inhibition of complement by development of complement inhibitor and transgenic animal organ. Here, we investigated the effects of rFII, a recombinant fibrinogenase from Agkistrodon acutus venom, on complement and HAR. The degradation effect of rFII on complement was tested by SDS-PAGE, CH50 examination, ELISA Kit and cofocal immunofluorescence microscopy in vitro and in vivo. An ex-vivo rat-to-human perfusion model and a vivo guinea-pig-to-rat heat HAR model were used to determine the protection of rFII against HAR. Our investigation indicated that rFII could significantly degrade human C5, C6, and C9, decrease the activity of complement, and inhibit the MAC deposition on HUVECs membrane in vitro. In addition, serum levels of C1q, C3 and C4 in rat were gradually reduced after infusion of rFII. Importantly, in an ex vivo rat-to-human perfusion model, the survival of rat hearts perfused with human serum treated with rFII (83.36 \u00b1 16.63 min) were significantly longer than that of hearts perfused with fresh human serum(15.94 \u00b1 4.75 min).

We also found that rFII significantly decreased the levels of C1q, C3 and C4 in human fresh serum perfusate. In a vivo guinea-pig-to-rat heat HAR model, the survival of rat hearts treated with rFII were significantly longer than that of hearts perfused with normal saline; and relieved heart damage by complete activation.

This study investigates the potential of a liquid-loaded pocketed microneedle device to deliver botulinum toxin A into the human dermis with the aim of reducing patient pain, improving therapeutic targeting and simplifying the administration procedure. Initially, \u03b2-galactosidase was employed as a detectable model for BT to (i) visualise liquid loading of the microneedles, (ii) determine residence time of a liquid formulation on the device and (iii) quantify loaded doses. An array of five stainless steel pocketed microneedles was shown to possess sufficient capacity to deliver therapeutic doses of the potent BT protein. Microneedle-mediated intradermal delivery of \u03b2-galactosidase and formaldehyde-inactivated botulinum toxoid revealed effective deposition and subsequent diffusion within the dermis. This study is the first to characterise pocketed microneedle delivery of a liquid formulation into human skin and illustrates the potential of such systems for the cutaneous administration of potent proteins such as BT.
