AChE is a cholinergic and agrin a synaptogenetic component. In spite of their different functions, they share several common features: their targeting is determined by alternative splicing; unlike most other NMJ components they are expressed in both, muscle and motor neuron and both reside on the synaptic basal lamina of the NMJ. Also, both were reported to play various nonjunctional roles. However, while the origin of basal lamina bound agrin is undoubtedly neural, the neural origin of AChE, which is anchored to the basal lamina with collagenic tail ColQ, is elusive. Hypothesizing that motor neuron proteins targeted to the NMJ basal lamina share common temporal pattern of expression, which is coordinated with the formation of basal lamina, we compared expression of agrin isoforms with the expression of AChE-T and ColQ in the developing rat spinal cord at the stages before and after the formation of NMJ basal lamina. Cellular origin of AChE-T and agrin was determined by in situ hybridization and their quantitative levels by RT PCR. We found parallel increase in expression of the synaptogenetic (agrin 8) isoform of agrin and ColQ after the formation of basal lamina supporting the view that ColQ bound AChE and agrin 8 isoform are destined to the basal lamina. Catalytic AChE-T subunit and agrin isoforms 19 and 0 followed different expression patterns.

Other proposed agonists of GPR18, including anandamide and abnormal cannabidiol, also failed to induce inhibition of calcium currents.

Although nanoparticle/nanogel-based delivery vehicles are showing potential for delivering vaccines to the immune system, there is little information on their characteristics of interaction with DCs. While particle uptake by DCs has been shown, the mechanism of cell targeting has not been studied. Moreover, it is still unclear how particle surface decoration influences the handling of such vaccines by DCs. Accordingly, chitosan nanogels carrying a model antigen, ovalbumin (ova), were analysed for interaction with and processing by DCs. Nanogel surfaces decorated with alginate (alg) or mannosylated alginate (alg-man), were used for targeting particular DC receptors. DC uptake of particles was observed, being dependent on endosomal-based processes. Inhibiting PI3-kinase or lipid raft activities impaired the uptake, which was only reduced, indicating the involvement of more than one endocytic pathway; notably, this was observed with both nanogel-delivered or free ova. Importantly, surface decoration of particles was less influential on particle uptake, contrasting with the ova cargo which played the major role. Such influence of the vaccine cargo has to date been largely ignored. When receptors interacting directly with ova were blocked, this altered the uptake of alg-nanogels and alg-man-nanogels carrying ova. The nanogels did have an influential role, in that modulation of DC functional activity owed more to the nanogel structure. Using an in vitro restimulation assay with ova-specific lymphocytes, nanogel-delivered and free ova were similarly effective at inducing specific antibody. Nanogel-delivered ova with mannose surface decoration was superior to free ova for inducing interferon-\u03b3 production by T-lymphocytes.

The type III secretion system (T3SS) aids acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection by injecting potent cytotoxins into host cells to suppress the host's innate immune response. Expression of all T3SS-related genes is strictly dependent on the transcription factor ExsA. Consequently, ExsA and the biological processes that regulate ExsA function are of great biomedical interest. The present study focused on the ExsA-ExsC-ExsD-ExsE signaling cascade, which ties host cell contact to the upregulation of T3SS gene expression. Prior to T3SS induction, the antiactivator protein ExsD binds to ExsA and blocks ExsA-dependent transcription by interfering with ExsA dimerization and promoter interactions. Upon host cell contact, ExsD is sequestered by the T3SS chaperone ExsC, resulting in the release of ExsA and upregulation of the T3SS. Previous studies have shown that the ExsD-ExsA interactions are not freely reversible. Because independently folded ExsD and ExsA were not found to interact, it has been hypothesized that folding intermediates of the two proteins form the complex. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that ExsD alone is sufficient to inhibit ExsA-dependent transcription in vitro and that no other cellular factors are required. More significantly, we show that independently folded ExsD and ExsA are capable of interacting, but only at 37 \u00b0C and not at 30 \u00b0C.

However, ectopic thyroid tissue in the adrenal gland (ETTAG) is not easy to understand on the basis of thyroid embryology; because it is so rare, the possibility of metastasis should first be considered. Here, we describe 2 cases of ETTAG with pathogenetic implications and review the literature. Patient findings: Two cases of ETTAG presented as incidental cystic adrenal masses in adult females, one having a congenital hernia of Morgagni. The ETTAG was histologically indistinguishable from normal orthotopic thyroid tissue, and its follicular nature was confirmed by immunohistochemical positivity for thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1/Titf-1/Nkx2.1), cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, CK 7, pendrin, human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), paired box gene 8 (PAX8) and FOXE1 (TTF-2), as well as positivity for the messenger RNA of the thyroglobulin gene by in situ hybridization analysis. No C cells (negativity for calcitonin, cromogranin and synaptophysin) were present. Neither BRAF nor KRAS mutations were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Further work-up did not show evidence of thyroid malignancy. Summary: ETTAG is a rare finding, with only 7 cases reported; women are much more frequently affected than men (8:1) and it usually clinically presents in the fifth decade (mean age: 54, range: 38-67) as a cystic adrenal mass incidentally discovered on abdominal ultrasonography and/or in computed tomography images. ETTAG is composed of normal follicular cells without C cells. The expression of some transcription factors (TTF-1, PAX8 and FOXE1) involved in development and/or migration of the medial thyroid anlage is preserved. Coexistence of a congenital hernia of Morgagni in one patient suggests an over-descent of medial thyroid anlage derived cells in its pathogenesis. Conclusion: Although ETTAG pathogenesis remains unknown, the lack of C cells together with the coexistence of a congenital defect of the anterior diaphragm (hernia of Morgagni) in one of our patients could suggest an over-descent of medial thyroid anlagen derived cells in the origin of this heterotopia.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [171, 172, true], [375, 376, true], [468, 469, true], [486, 487, true], [613, 614, true], [1091, 1092, true], [1175, 1176, true], [1272, 1273, true], [1333, 1334, true], [1342, 1343, true], [1650, 1651, true], [1712, 1713, true], [1865, 1866, true], [2012, 2013, true], [2024, 2025, true], [2317, 2318, true]]}, {"id": 23063413, "text": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an active efflux pump affecting the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of drugs that are P-gp substrates.

The 313-11 cell line was >50-fold resistant to Vin and over-expressed P-gp, as determined by Western immunoblots. Increased expression of P-gp was mediated by up-regulation of the MDR1 transcript. The reduced potency of different classes of HCV replication inhibitors in the 313-11 P-gp cell line was restored in the presence of known P-gp inhibitors. Addition of the P-gp inhibitor, tariquidar, increased the uptake of a radiolabeled HCV replication inhibitor by 14-fold in the 313-11 replicon cell line.

We find that TRPA-1, a cold-sensitive TRP channel, detects temperature drop in the environment to extend lifespan.

Furthermore, information also was obtained from some local and foreign books on ethnobotany and ethnomedicines. RESULTS: Curculigo orchioides, Curculigo capitulata and Curculigo pilosa have been used as traditional medicine to treat kinds of diseases such as impotence, limb limpness, gastrointestinal and heart diseases, etc. Phytochemical investigation of eight species of the genus Curculigo has resulted in identification of more than 110 compounds.

Aging increased iNOS expression and S-nitrosation of major proteins involved in insulin signaling, thereby reducing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Conversely, aged iNOS-null mice were protected from S-nitrosation-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, pharmacological treatment with an iNOS inhibitor and acute exercise reduced iNOS-induced S-nitrosation and increased insulin sensitivity in the muscle of aged animals.

Mucosal wounds in inflammatory disorders compromise the critical epithelial barrier. In response to injury, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) rapidly migrate to reseal wounds. We have previously observed that a membrane associated, Actin binding protein, Annexin A2 (AnxA2), is up-regulated in migrating IECs and plays an important role in promoting wound closure. To identify the mechanisms by which AnxA2 promotes IEC movement and wound closure we used a loss of function approach. AnxA2 specific shRNA was utilized to generate IECs with stable down-regulation of AnxA2. Loss of AnxA2 inhibited IEC migration while promoting enhanced cell-matrix adhesion. These functional effects were associated with increased levels of \u03b21 integrin protein, which is reported to play an important role in mediating the cell-matrix adhesive properties of epithelial cells. Since cell migration requires dynamic turnover of integrin based adhesions, we tested if AnxA2 modulates internalization of cell surface \u03b21 integrin required for forward cell movement. Indeed, pulse-chase biotinylation experiments in IECs lacking AnxA2 demonstrated a significant increase in cell surface \u03b21 integrin that was accompanied by decreased \u03b21 integrin internalization and degradation.

It is shown that a correlation exists between sonoluminescence, and the ultraharmonic and broadband signals extracted from the cavitation noise spectra. The signals can be utilized to characterize different regimes of cavitation activity at different acoustic power densities. When cavitation activity sets on, the aforementioned signals correlate to fluctuations in the Schlieren contrast as well as the number of nucleated bubbles extracted from the Schlieren Images.

Kawazulite flakes with a thickness of a few tens of nanometers were prepared by mechanical exfoliation. They exhibit a low intrinsic bulk doping level and correspondingly a sizable mobility of surface state carriers of more than 1000 cm(2)/(V s) at low temperature. Based on these findings, further minerals which due to their minimized defect densities display even better electronic characteristics may be identified in the future.", "anno": [[143, 144, true], [267, 268, true], [417, 418, true], [650, 651, true], [754, 755, true], [916, 917, true], [1084, 1085, true]]}, {"id": 23266567, "text": "Dietary supplementation with \u03c9-3 long chain fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has increased in popularity in recent years and adequate DHA supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood is of clinical importance.

Adequate DHA availability in the fetus/infant optimizes brain and retinal maturation in part by influencing neurotransmitter pathways. The anti-inflammatory properties of LCPUFA are largely mediated through modulation of signaling either directly through binding to receptors or through changes in lipid raft formation and receptor presentation. Our goal is to review the current findings on DHA supplementation, specifically in pregnancy and infant neurodevelopment, as a pharmacologic agent with both preventative and therapeutic value.

Compared to adults, younger individuals accumulate greater Mn levels in the CNS and are more vulnerable to its toxicity. Moreover, the mechanisms mediating developmental Mn-induced neurotoxicity are not completely understood. The present study investigated the developmental neurotoxicity elicited by Mn exposure (5, 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg; i.p.) from postnatal day 8 to PN27 in rats. Neurochemical analyses were carried out on PN29, with a particular focus on striatal alterations in intracellular signaling pathways (MAPKs, Akt and DARPP-32), oxidative stress generation and cell death. Motor alterations were evaluated later in life at 3, 4 or 5\u00a0weeks of age. Mn exposure (20\u00a0mg/kg) increased p38(MAPK) and Akt phosphorylation, but decreased DARPP-32-Thr-34 phosphorylation. Mn (10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg) increased caspase activity and F(2)-isoprostane production (a biological marker of lipid peroxidation). Paralleling the changes in striatal biochemical parameters, Mn (20\u00a0mg/kg) also caused motor impairment, evidenced by increased falling latency in the rotarod test, decreased distance traveled and motor speed in the open-field test. Notably, the antioxidant Trolox\u2122 reversed the Mn (20\u00a0mg/kg)-dependent augmentation in p38(MAPK) phosphorylation and reduced the Mn (20\u00a0mg/kg)-induced caspase activity and F(2)-isoprostane production. Trolox\u2122 also reversed the Mn-induced motor coordination deficits. These findings are the first to show that long-term exposure to Mn during a critical period of neurodevelopment causes motor coordination dysfunction with parallel increment in oxidative stress markers, p38(MAPK) phosphorylation and caspase activity in the striatum.

These results highlight that, although hydrophobic domains are key components of IRI activity, the random inclusion of addition hydrophobic units does not guarantee an increase in activity and that the actual polymer conformation is important.", "anno": [[222, 223, true], [436, 437, true], [613, 614, true], [851, 852, true], [979, 980, true], [1089, 1090, true], [1271, 1272, true], [1515, 1516, true]]}, {"id": 23252745, "text": "Human cathepsin B has many house-keeping functions, such as protein turnover in lysosomes.

The kinetic parameters and modes of inhibition were characterized, and the selectivities of the most promising inhibitors were determined. The best performing inhibitor 17 was effective in cell-based in vitro models of tumor invasion, where it significantly abrogated invasion of MCF-10A neoT cells.

In this review, two series of synthetic peptides and their selective effects on the inflammatory response have been described, focusing on the intracellular pathways involved and on their therapeutic potential. A series of F(D)LF(D)LF analogs has been synthesized, including either N- t-Boc or different N-ureido substituents. The free acid derivatives as they are good candidates as antiinflammatory drugs are able to antagonize the multiple neutrophil functions evoked by N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-Lphenylalanine (fMLF), i.e. chemotaxis, superoxide anion production and lysozyme release. Their methyl-ester derivatives are ineffective. The second series of peptides derives from the endogenous protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor PKI55, a 55-amino acid protein, whose synthesis is induced by PKC activation, so that a feedback loop of inhibition is established. In vitro experiments showed that PKI55 inhibits recombinant PKC isoforms \u03b1, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b6, ; to identify the minimal amino acid sequence of PKI55 protein maintaining the inhibitory effects on PKC, peptides derived from both C- and N-terminal sequences have been synthesized. The N-terminal peptides 5 (MLYKLHDVCRQLWFSC), 8 (CRQLWFSC) and 9 (CRQLW), that in human neutrophils retain the inhibitory activity on PKC, decrease the chemotaxis, and, in mice, display anti-inflammatory and analgesic action, after both central and peripheral administration of very low doses.

Previously, we found that the baker's yeast cytosolic thioredoxin Trx2 undergoes cross-linking to form several protein-protein complexes in cells treated with the bifunctional electrophile divinyl sulfone (DVSF). Here, we report that the peroxiredoxin Tsa1 and the thioredoxin reductase Trr1, both of which function in a redox relay network with thioredoxin, become cross-linked in complexes with Trx2 upon DVSF treatment. Treatment of yeast with other bifunctional electrophiles, including diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DAD), mechlorethamine (HN2), and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), resulted in the formation of similar cross-linked complexes. Cross-linking of Trx2 and Tsa1 to other proteins by DVSF and DAD is dependent on modification of the active site Cys residues within these proteins. In addition, the human cytosolic thioredoxin, cytosolic thioredoxin reductase, and peroxiredoxin 2 form cross-linked complexes to other proteins in the presence of DVSF, although each protein shows different susceptibilities to modification by DAD, HN2, and DEB.

We discuss an oncogene-induced mitotic stress model that provides a mechanistic framework to explain this paradox. We also review the tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing consequences of W-CIN. Importantly, we do this in the context of cancer as a complex systemic disease, rather than as a simple linearly progressing disorder that arises from a single abnormal cell population. Accordingly, we highlight the often neglected effects of W-CIN on key non-cell-autonomous entities, such as the immune system and the tumor microenvironment. Distinct tissue-specific susceptibilities to W-CIN-induced tumorigenesis and the clinical implications of W-CIN are also discussed.Oncogene advance online publication, 14 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.616.", "anno": [[141, 142, true], [263, 264, true], [378, 379, true], [458, 459, true], [644, 645, true], [802, 803, true], [934, 935, true], [1013, 1014, true]]}, {"id": 23541928, "text": "Biodegradable oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF) composite hydrogels have been investigated for the delivery of growth factors (GFs) with the aid of gelatin microparticles (GMPs) and stem cell populations for osteochondral tissue regeneration. In this study, a bilayered OPF composite hydrogel that mimics the distinctive hierarchical structure of native osteochondral tissue was utilized to investigate the effect of transforming growth factor-\u03b23 (TGF-\u03b23) with varying release kinetics and/or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on osteochondral tissue regeneration in a rabbit full-thickness osteochondral defect model. The four groups investigated included (i) a blank control (no GFs), (ii) GMP-loaded IGF-1 alone, (iii) GMP-loaded IGF-1 and gel-loaded TGF-\u03b23, and (iv) GMP-loaded IGF-1 and GMP-loaded TGF-\u03b23 in OPF composite hydrogels. The results of an in vitro release study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b23 release kinetics could be modulated by the GF incorporation method. At 12weeks post-implantation, the quality of tissue repair in both chondral and subchondral layers was analyzed based on quantitative histological scoring. All groups incorporating GFs resulted in a significant improvement in cartilage morphology compared to the control. Single delivery of IGF-1 showed higher scores in subchondral bone morphology as well as chondrocyte and glycosaminoglycan amount in adjacent cartilage tissue when compared to a dual delivery of IGF-1 and TGF-\u03b23, independent of the TGF-\u03b23 release kinetics.

Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise greatly increases the number of new neurons that are produced in the hippocampal formation. In contrast, mental training via skill learning increases the numbers that survive, particularly when the training goals are challenging. Both manipulations can increase cognitive performance in the future, some of which are reportedly mediated by the presence of new neurons in the adult hippocampus.

Thirty-two chemicals were tested blind in the battery of in vitro and in silico methods selected during the first phase of the project. This paper describes the classification approaches studied: single step procedures and two step tiered testing strategies. In summary, four in vitro testing strategies were proposed as best performing in terms of predictive capacity with respect to the European acute oral toxicity classification. In addition, a heuristic testing strategy is suggested that combines the prediction results gained from the neutral red uptake assay performed in 3T3 cells, with information on neurotoxicity alerts identified by the primary rat brain aggregates test method.
