An emerging body of evidence suggests that it may be possible to identify women who are more likely to have favorable outcomes and less likely to have adverse events on HT, as well as to tailor the optimal dose, formulation, and route of delivery of treatment, by the use of individual risk stratification and a personalized approach. Several clinical characteristics that have been proposed for this purpose include a woman's age, time since menopause, symptom severity, baseline vascular health, risk for breast cancer, biomarker levels, and genetic predisposition.

Intravenous injection of 5A in C57BL/6 mice increased plasma-free cholesterol (5A: 89.9 \u00b1 13.6 mg/dl; control: 38.7 \u00b1 4.3 mg/dl (mean \u00b1 S.D.); P < 0.05) and triglycerides (5A: 887.0 \u00b1 172.0 mg/dl; control: 108.9 \u00b1 9.9 mg/dl; P < 0.05), whereas the EE peptide containing E in both positions had no effect. Finally, 5A increased cholesterol efflux approximately 2.5-fold in vivo from radiolabeled macrophages, whereas the EE peptide was inactive. These results provide a rationale for future design of therapeutic apolipoprotein mimetic peptides and provide new insights into the interaction of hydrophobic residues on apolipoproteins with phospholipids in the lipid microdomain created by the ABCA1 transporter during the cholesterol efflux process.", "anno": [[141, 142, true], [287, 288, true], [506, 507, true], [732, 733, true], [925, 926, true], [1230, 1231, true], [1370, 1371, true], [1674, 1675, true]]}, {"id": 23042954, "text": "Control of brain seizures after exposure to nerve agents is imperative for the prevention of brain damage and death.

However, in a real-case scenario of an unexpected attack with nerve agents, pretreatment would not be possible, and medical assistance may not be available immediately. To determine if control of seizures and survival are still possible without pretreatment or immediate pharmacologic intervention, we studied the anticonvulsant efficacy of the GluK1 (GluR5)/\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist (3S,4aR,6R,8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl]decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY293558) in rats that did not receive any treatment until 20 minutes after exposure to the nerve agent soman.

There is a conundrum in the activation of AVP in that AVP and pVI are sequence-independent DNA-binding proteins with nm equilibrium dissociation constants such that in the virus particle, they are predicted to be essentially irreversibly bound to the viral DNA. Here, we resolve that conundrum by showing that activation of AVP takes place on the one-dimensional contour of DNA. In vitro, pVI, a substrate, slides on DNA via one-dimensional diffusion, D(1) = 1.45 \u00d7 10(6) bp(2)/s, until it binds to AVP also on the same DNA molecule. AVP, partially activated by being bound to DNA, excises pVIc, which binds to the AVP molecule that cut it out. pVIc then forms a disulfide bond with AVP forming the fully active AVP-pVIc complex bound to DNA. In vivo, in heat-disrupted immature virus, AVP was also activated by pVI in DNA-dependent reactions.

In order to obtain a meaningful comparison, it is crucial that the graft lengths of the polymers that are grafted from and to the substrates are essentially identical. Herein, this was achieved by utilizing the free polymer formed in parallel to the grafting-from reaction as the polymer for the grafting-to reaction. Four graft lengths were investigated, and the molar masses of the four free polymers (21 \u2264 M(n) \u2264 100 kDa; 1.07 \u2264 \u0110(M) \u2264 1.26), i.e. the polymers subsequently employed in the grafting-to reaction, were shown to be in the same range as the molar masses of the polymers grafted from the surface (23 \u2264 M(n) \u2264 87 kDa; 1.08 \u2264 \u0110(M) \u2264 1.31).

In comparison, for the grafting-to reaction, the grafted content could not be controlled by varying the length of the preformed polymer: the polymer content was essentially the same for the four graft lengths.

A previous study demonstrated that the core structural information required to impart the procognitive activity of the AngIV analog, norleucine(1)-angiotensin IV, resides in its three N-terminal amino acids, Nle-Tyr-Ile.

Noticeably higher permeation was observed during the active phase in on-off studies. Excellent correlation was observed in permeation (r(2) = 0.98) and drug load (r(2) = 0.97) with the increase in applied voltage (3-12\u2009V), indicating that the current technique is predictable. The data observed suggest that any further increase in voltage could eventually lead to increase in the permeation and drug load, as the saturation level is very distant. Furthermore, the enhancement in permeation with the applied voltage (3-12\u2009V) was found to be 6-20 folds, compared to the passive process.

At nanomolar concentrations MP (0.01, 0.1 and 1 nM) significantly attenuated the 6-OHDA- and hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The reactive oxygen species generated by 6-OHDA in SH-SY5Y cells was also inhibited by MP in a concentration dependent fashion. Further, intranigral damage induced by stereotaxically injecting 6-OHDA in mouse brain was significantly attenuated by MP treatment. MP (1, 10 or 50 \u03bcg/kg, i.p.) prevented apomorphine-induced rotational behavior and significantly improved motor deficits in 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. The cognitive impairments as evaluated by passive avoidance and Y-maze task in mice were also attenuated by MP concentration dependently. Immunohistochemical analysis of substantia nigra in MP treated mice showed significantly higher number of surviving tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells. Furthermore, MP also suppressed the lipid peroxidation products in 6-OHDA-lesioned mouse brain tissues. Considering the results obtained, the marked neuroprotection exhibited by MP might be attributed to its potent antioxidant property.

The acoustic levitation device coupled with non-invasive spectroscopy enabled monitoring of the recrystallisation process of the difficult-to-handle (adhesive) amorphous sample.

The recrystallisation kinetic parameters were estimated from the recrystallisation profiles. While the empirical recrystallisation rate constant determined by NIR and Raman spectroscopy were comparable, the lag time for recrystallisation was significantly lower with Raman spectroscopy as compared to NIRS. This observation was explained by the high energy density of the Raman laser beam, which might have led to local heating effects of the sample and thus reduced the recrystallisation onset time.

ApoE secreted by macrophages has a more acidic isoform distribution, and it increases binding of reconstituted VLDL particles to hepatocytes and fibroblasts more effectively than apoE secreted by adipocytes.

When curcumin was combined at concentrations of 1.25-2.5 \u03bcM with sirolimus at concentrations from 0.63 to 1.25 ng/ml the effects were synergistic. Combination of curcumin (1.25-2.5 \u03bcM) with sirolimus (5 ng/ml) showed additive effects. The effects after combination of curcumin at 5 \u03bcM with each sirolimus concentration and sirolimus at 10 ng/ml with each curcumin concentration were presumably antagonistic. We conclude that the immunosuppressive effects of curcumin and sirolimus in low concentrations are synergistic in OKT3-activated PBMC. Whether curcumin and sirolimus have also synergistic antiproliferative effects in tumor cells has to be shown in further experiments including animal models.", "anno": [[163, 164, true], [478, 479, true], [637, 638, true], [733, 734, true], [875, 876, true], [946, 947, true], [1203, 1204, true], [1350, 1351, true], [1438, 1439, true], [1611, 1612, true], [1746, 1747, true], [1904, 1905, true]]}, {"id": 23080379, "text": "The self-assembly of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) onto a patterned silica surface generated from surface microcontact click printing is presented.

Here, we investigate SA-DNAm changes in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) upon long-term culture, irradiation-induced senescence, immortalization, and reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) using high-density HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. SA-DNAm changes are highly reproducible and they are enriched in intergenic and nonpromoter regions of developmental genes. Furthermore, SA-hypomethylation in particular appears to be associated with H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and Polycomb-group 2 target genes. We demonstrate that ionizing irradiation, although associated with a senescence phenotype, does not affect SA-DNAm. Furthermore, overexpression of the catalytic subunit of the human telomerase (TERT) or conditional immortalization with a doxycycline-inducible system (TERT and SV40-TAg) result in telomere extension, but do not prevent SA-DNAm. In contrast, we demonstrate that reprogramming into iPSC prevents almost the entire set of SA-DNAm changes. Our results indicate that long-term culture is associated with an epigenetically controlled process that stalls cells in a particular functional state, whereas irradiation-induced senescence and immortalization are not causally related to this process.

Using computer analysis, we recently identified nuclear aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding sites termed \"dioxin response elements\" (DREs) in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of efflux transporter ABCG2 (Accession No. EU570105) from the bovine mammary gland. As these regulatory motifs mediate regulation of target genes by AhR agonists including TCDD and prochloraz, we have systematically investigated the effect of both contaminants on functional ABCG2 transport activity in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells. TCDD or prochloraz doubled ABCG2-mediated Hoechst H33342 secretion. This effect was almost completely reversed by specific ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that this induction was due to binding of activated AhR to DRE sequences in the ABCG2 5'-UTR. Receptor binding was significantly reduced by specific AhR antagonist salicyl amide. Induction of AhR by TCDD and prochloraz resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase of ABCG2 gene expression and transporter protein levels. As ABCG2 represents the main mammary transporter for xenobiotics including drugs and toxins, exposure to prevalent AhR agonists may enhance transporter-mediated secretion of potential harmful compounds into milk.

The Hdac3 CKO(OCN) mice exhibited reduced cortical bone mineralization and material properties and suffered frequent fractures.

Zymosan a cell-wall preparation from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is largely used to activate neutrophils in its opsonized form. In this study, we show that non-opsonized zymosan alone induced ROS production by human neutrophils. Zymosan-induced ROS production is higher than the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF)- or the phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced ROS production but is lower than the one induced by opsonized zymosan. Most of the zymosan-induced ROS production is intracellular. Interestingly, zymosan induced the phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase cytosolic component p47phox on several sites which are Ser315, Ser328 and Ser345. Zymosan induced also the activation of the small G-protein Rac2. Phosphorylation of the p47phox as well as Rac2 activation were inhibited by genistein a broad range protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor and by wortmannin a PI3Kinase inhibitor. GF109203X a PKC inhibitor inhibited phosphorylation of p47phox on Ser315 and Ser328. SB203580 and UO126, inhibitors of p38MAPK and ERK1/2-pathway, respectively, inhibited phosphorylation of p47phox on Ser345. Zymosan-induced ROS production was completely inhibited by genistein and wortmannin and partially inhibited by SB203580, UO126 and GF109203X. These results show that zymosan alone is able to activate NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils via the phosphorylation of p47phox and Rac2 activation and that a protein tyrosine kinase, PI3Kinase, p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and PKC are involved in this process.

The therapeutic potential of curcumin as a PS is limited by its low aqueous solubility, susceptibility to hydrolytic and photolytic degradation, and limited phototoxicity toward Gram negative (G-) bacteria. Supersaturated solutions of curcumin have demonstrated high phototoxicity toward several species of Gram positive (G+) bacteria as well as the G-Escherichia (E) coli. Thus, solid dispersions that can form supersaturated solutions of curcumin upon hydration may be beneficial in aPDT. In the present study, solid dispersions of curcumin have been prepared through lyophilization of concentrated solutions obtained from dissolution of hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD)-curcumin co-precipitates. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) was added to curcumin solutions prior to lyophilization. The resulting lyophilizates were porous, amorphous and hydrated and dissolved rapidly in contact with a model physiological salt solution.
