Chalcones are structural analogues of benzalacetophenone (BAP). Several derivatives have been identified in plants and anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties were attributed to the compounds, probably related to their direct antioxidant activity or stimulatory effects on the expression of endogenous defence enzymes like hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1). HO-1 expression is triggered by the Nrf2-Keap1 signalling pathway, initiated by the addition of chalcones to thiol groups of Keap1 via Michael-type reaction. 2. The present study used a model system estimating the reactivity of different synthetic chalcones and other \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with thiols and compared the chemical reactivity with the biological activity, measured by HO-1 expression in human dermal fibroblasts. 3. Chemical reactivity with the thiol group of N-acetylcysteine was determined with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and followed chemical principles of structure-reactivity relationship.

There is a strong electronic coupling between ferrocenyl moieties, and superior electron-transport ability exists through these semirigid molecular wires. Standard rate constants for the electron transfer between the electrode and the ferrocenyl moieties were measured for the monolayers by a potential-step chronoamperometry technique. The electron conduction through the molecular wires was estimated using the monolayers as a bridge from the Au(111) metal surface to the gold tip of a conductive atomic force microscope (CAFM).

In order to better understand the relationship between type I collagen self-assembly and D-spacing distribution, we investigated surface-mediated collagen self-assembly as a function of substrate and incubation concentration. Collagen fibril assembly on phlogopite and muscovite mica as well as fibrillar gel coextrusion in glass capillary tubes all exhibited D-spacing distributions similar to those commonly observed in biological tissues. The observation of D-spacing distribution by self-assembly of type I collagen alone is significant as it eliminates the necessity to invoke other preassembly or postassembly hypotheses, such as variation in the content of collagen types, enzymatic cross-linking, or other post-translational modifications, as mechanistic origins of D-spacing distribution. The D-spacing distribution on phlogopite mica is independent of type I collagen concentration, but on muscovite mica D-spacing distributions showed increased negative skewness at 20 \u03bcg/mL and higher concentrations. Tilted D-spacing angles were found to correlate with decreased D-spacing measurements, an effect that can be removed with a tilt angle correction, resulting in no concentration dependence of D-spacing distribution on muscovite mica.

Acidification of test water revealed that the Pb and Pb(2+) LC50 values were impacted by the pH manipulation method, with the following order of effects: HCl<CO2<MOPS.

Blood Na(+) levels remained relatively stable in all tested animals, but gill NKA activities were lower in eels exposed to combined stress. No apparent branchial lesions were detected following the different treatments and immunolocalization of NKA revealed well-differentiated ionocytes.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the generality of this latter effect, the present study employed a delay-discounting task to determine if acute and sub-chronic nicotine will also increase impulsive choice when subjective reward value is manipulated by changes in the probability, rather than magnitude, of reward. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were presented with two levers, one of which delivered an immediate water reward on half of the trials, while the other lever delivered the same reward on every trial, but only after one of five increasing delays. RESULTS: Acute injections of 1.2\u00a0mg/kg, but not 0.8\u00a0mg/kg, of nicotine increased the preference for the immediate (but less certain) reward lever at intermediate delays. Moreover, twice-daily injections of 0.8\u00a0mg/kg of nicotine for 6\u00a0days progressively increased the preference for the immediate reward. Latency to make the first response on each trial was not affected by nicotine. CONCLUSIONS: The similar increases in impulsive choice produced by both acute and sub-chronic nicotine in delay-discounting paradigms whether subjective reward value is manipulated by changes in reward magnitude or probability suggests that nicotine may be increasing what is common to these paradigms, namely delay discounting.

First, we examined the physicochemical properties of these three classes of molecules and identified characteristic features resulting from their distinctive biological functions. For example, human metabolites and TCM molecules can be larger and more hydrophobic than drugs, which makes them less likely to cross membranes. We then quantified the shifts in physicochemical property space induced by metabolism from a holistic perspective by analyzing a data set of several thousand experimentally observed metabolic trees. Results show how the metabolic system aims to retain nutrients/micronutrients while facilitating a rapid elimination of xenobiotics. In the third part we compared these global shifts with the contributions made by individual metabolic reactions. For better resolution, all reactions were classified into phase I and phase II biotransformations. Interestingly, not all metabolic reactions lead to more hydrophilic molecules.

In contrast, the desensitization caused by GTS-21's dihydroxy metabolite (2,4diOHBA) is relatively short-lived.

During the latter exposure, fish were monitored for survival till all fish had died, and (during the first 8h of this exposure) for changes in whole-body Na levels and lipid peroxidation (LPO). During the high-level Cu exposure, fish pre-exposed to copper had a significantly longer time-to-death than did the control fish.

Using a biochemometric approach, the qHNMR purity and anti-TB activity of successive chromatographic fractions of O. horridus triterpenes were correlated by linear regression analysis to generate a mathematical QPAR model. The results demonstrate that impurities, such as widely occurring monoglycerides, can have a profound impact on the observed antimycobacterial activity of triterpene-enriched fractions. The QPAR concept is shown to be capable of providing a quantitative assessment in situations where residually complex constitution contributes toward the biological activity of natural products.", "anno": [[257, 258, true], [433, 434, true], [609, 610, true], [832, 833, true], [1018, 1019, true], [1213, 1214, true]]}, {"id": 23356740, "text": "In invertebrates, the phenolamines, tyramine and octopamine, mediate many functional roles usually associated with the catecholamines, noradrenaline and adrenaline, in vertebrates. The \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic classes of insect octopamine receptor are better activated by octopamine than tyramine. Similarly, the Tyramine 1 subgroup of receptors (or Octopamine/Tyramine receptors) are better activated by tyramine than octopamine. However, recently, a new Tyramine 2 subgroup of receptors was identified, which appears to be activated highly preferentially by tyramine. We examined immunocytochemically the ability of CG7431, the founding member of this subgroup from Drosophila melanogaster, to be internalized in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by different agonists. It was only internalized after activation by tyramine. Conversely, the structurally related receptor, CG16766, was internalized by a number of biogenic amines, including octopamine, dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, which also were able to elevate cyclic AMP levels. Studies with synthetic agonists and antagonists confirm that CG16766 has a different pharmacological profile to that of CG7431. Species orthologues of CG16766 were only found in Drosophila species, whereas orthologues of CG7431 could be identified in the genomes of a number of insect species. We propose that CG16766 represents a new group of tyramine receptors, which we have designated the Tyramine 3 receptors.", "anno": [[179, 180, true], [291, 292, true], [424, 425, true], [563, 564, true], [777, 778, true], [832, 833, true], [1047, 1048, true], [1175, 1176, true], [1341, 1342, true], [1462, 1463, true]]}]}
