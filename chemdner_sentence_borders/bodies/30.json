In vivo administration of Ad/chitosan-PEG or Ad/chitosan-PEG-FA into mice demonstrated that PEGylation greatly increased blood circulation time, resulting in 9.0-fold and 48.9-fold increases at 24h after injection compared with naked Ad, respectively. In addition, generation of Ad-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice treated with Ad/chitosan-PEG-FA was markedly decreased by 75.3% compared with naked Ad. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay results showed a 285.0-fold increase in tumor tissues and a 378-fold reduction of Ad/chitosan-PEG-FA in liver tissues compared with naked Ad. Bioluminescence imaging study further supported the enhanced tumor-to-liver ratio of Ad/chitosan-PEG-FA. Consequently, systemic delivery of Ad/chitosan-PEG-FA significantly inhibited the growth of FR-positive tumor, decreasing 52.8% compared to the naked Ad-treated group. Importantly, PEGylated oncolytic Ad nanocomplexes showed no elevation of both alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels, demonstrating that systemically delivered Ad-related hepatic damage can be completely eliminated with PEG conjugation. In sum, these results demonstrate that conjugation of chitosan-PEG-FA to oncolytic Ad significantly improves antitumor efficacy and safety profiles, suggesting that Ad/chitosan-PEG-FA has potential as a therapeutic agent to target FR-positive cancer via systemic administration.", "anno": [[62, 63, true], [305, 306, true], [732, 733, true], [876, 877, true], [1128, 1129, true], [1287, 1288, true], [1478, 1479, true], [1583, 1584, true], [1751, 1752, true], [2004, 2005, true], [2283, 2284, true]]}, {"id": 23562634, "text": "Ductal drug therapy is a novel therapeutic approach for primary breast cancers, particularly those involving ductal carcinoma in situ lesions.

METHODS: An fMRI study was conducted according to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design in 13 healthy volunteers. Participants received cetirizine 15\u00a0mg (an antihistamine), verapamil 120\u00a0mg (a P-gp blocker), a combination of cetirizine + verapamil, and a placebo.

The ANT measures three independent attention domains: i.e., alerting, orienting, and executive attention.

Recent studies have shown that PBDE-47 is neurotoxic to animals and possibly humans. However, the basis for the neurotoxicity of PBDEs and their metabolites is unclear. For example, it is not known whether PBDEs affect adult neurogenesis, a process implicated in learning and memory and in olfactory behavior. In this study, we examined the toxicity of PBDEs for primary adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNSCs) isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mice. We discovered that 6-OH-PBDE-47, but not its parent compound PBDE-47, is cytotoxic for aNCSs using MTS metabolism and cell number as a measure of cytotoxicity. Interestingly, 6-OH-PBDE-47 induced apoptosis at concentrations above 7.5\u03bcM inhibited proliferation at 2.5-5\u03bcM while suppressing neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation at submicromolar concentrations (\u2264 1\u03bcM). The effect on proliferation was reversed upon removal of 6-OH-PBDE-47 and correlated with selective but reversible inhibition of ERK5 activation by mitogenic growth factors EGF and bFGF. 6-OH-PBDE-47 also inhibited the proneuronal differentiation effect of neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and NT3 activation of ERK5.

The objective of this work was to identify the role of Nrf2 in the regulation of ACD. We used the Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) and the Mouse Ear Swelling Test (MEST) to study the role of Nrf2 in both the sensitization and elicitation phase in nrf2 knock out (nrf2(-/-)) and wild type (nrf2(+/+)) mice. Five chemicals were used: two compounds known to react with cysteine residues, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and cinnamaldehyde (CinA); one sensitizer known to exhibit mixed reactivity to cysteine and lysine residues, isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI); and one reacting specifically with lysine residues, trimellitic anhydride (TMA) and croton oil a well-known irritant. In the MEST assay, DNCB (1% and 2%) induced a significant increase in ear thickness in nrf2(-/-) as compared to nrf2(+/+) mice suggesting a role for Nrf2 in the control of the inflammatory process.

CV risk factors, preexisting CVD, and NT-proBNP levels were evaluated at baseline. All-cause and CV mortality were assessed 5.5 years after baseline examination. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate mortality hazard ratios (HRs).RESULTSDuring the follow-up period, 390 people died (175 for CVD) out of 9,101 person-years of observations. A significantly increased mortality risk by quartiles of NT-proBNP was observed (test for trend, P < 0.001). NT-proBN P values >91 pg/mL conferred HRs of 2.05 (95% CI 1.47-2.86) for all-cause and 4.47 (2.38-8.39) for CV mortality, independently of CV risk factors, including CRP and albumin excretion rate (AER).

Here, we measure expression and noise as a function of TF activity for 16 native targets of the transcription factor Zap1 that are regulated by it through diverse mechanisms. For most activated and repressed Zap1 targets, noise decreases as expression increases. Kinetic modeling suggests that this is due to two distinct Zap1-mediated mechanisms that both change the frequency of transcriptional bursts. Notably, we found that another mechanism of repression by Zap1, which is encoded in the promoter DNA, likely decreases the size of transcriptional bursts, producing a unique transcriptional state characterized by low expression and low noise. In addition, we find that further reduction in noise is achieved when a single TF both activates and represses a single target gene. Our results suggest a global principle whereby at low TF concentrations, the dominant source of differences in expression between promoters stems from differences in burst frequency, whereas at high TF concentrations differences in burst size dominate.

The IT consisted of the mAb CD133/1 (AC133) bound to the ribosome inactivating plant toxin saporin (anti-CD133/1-sap). We show that TPCS2a-PCI of anti-CD133/1-sap is specific, and highly cytotoxic at femto-molar concentrations. Specific binding and uptake of CD133/1, was shown by fluorescence microscopy and co-localization with TPCS2a in endosomes/lysosomes was determined by confocal microscopy. CD133(high) WiDr cells, isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting, had a 7-fold higher capacity to initiate spheroids than CD133(low) cells (P<0.001) and were resistant to photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, PDT-resistance was bypassed by the PCI strategy. Tumor initiation and aggressive growth in athymic nude mice was obtained with only 10 CD133(high) cells in contrast to CD133(low) cells where substantially higher cell numbers were needed. The excellent high efficacy and selectivity of eliminating CD133-expressing cells by PCI warrant further pre-clinical evaluations of this novel therapeutic approach.", "anno": [[127, 128, true], [316, 317, true], [584, 585, true], [759, 760, true], [878, 879, true], [987, 988, true], [1158, 1159, true], [1364, 1365, true], [1422, 1423, true], [1611, 1612, true], [1777, 1778, true]]}, {"id": 23567041, "text": "A promising approach for local drug delivery is high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-triggered release of drugs from stimuli-responsive nanoparticles such as liposomes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether another release mechanism is involved with HIFU-triggered release from liposomes beside cavitation and temperature. Furthermore, it was studied whether this new release mechanism allows the release of lipophilic compounds. Therefore, both a lipophilic (Nile red) and a hydrophilic (fluorescein) compound were loaded into thermosensitive (TSL) or non-thermosensitive liposomes (NTSL) and the liposomes were subjected both to continuous wave- (CW) and pulsed wave (PW)-HIFU. The mean liposome size varied from 97 to 139nm with a polydispersity index (PDI)\u22640.06 for the different formulations. The Tm of the phospholipid bilayer of the TSL was around 42\u00b0C. Approximately 80% of fluorescein was released within 15min from TSL at temperatures\u226542\u00b0C. In contrast, no fluorescein release from NTSL and NR release from both TSL and NTSL was observed at temperatures up to 60\u00b0C. CW-HIFU exposure of TSL resulted in rapid temperature elevation up to 52\u00b0C and subsequently almost quantitative fluorescein release. Fluorescein release from NTSL was also substantial (~64% after 16min at 20W). Surprisingly, CW-HIFU exposure (20W for 16min) resulted in the release of NR from TSL (~66% of the loaded amount), and this was even higher from NTSL (~78%). PW-HIFU exposure did not result in temperatures above the Tm of TSL. However, nearly 85% of fluorescein was released from TSL after 32min at 20W of PW-HIFU exposure, whereas the release from NTSL was around 27%. Interestingly, NR release from NTSL was~30% after 2min PW-HIFU exposure and increased to~70% after 32min. Furthermore, addition of microbubbles to the liposomes prior to PW-HIFU exposure did not result in more release, which suggests that cavitation can be excluded as the main mechanism responsible for the triggered release of both a hydrophilic and a lipophilic model compound from liposomes. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that the mean size and PDI of the liposomes did not significantly change after CW- and PW-HIFU exposure. Taken together, it is therefore concluded that neither temperature elevation nor inertial cavitation is essential for the release of both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds from liposomes. It is assumed that the release originates from radiation force-induced acoustic streaming, causing the liposomes to collide at the walls of the exposure chamber leading to shear forces which in turn results in reversible liposome destabilization and release of both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds.", "anno": [[171, 172, true], [336, 337, true], [443, 444, true], [693, 694, true], [811, 812, true], [874, 875, true], [964, 965, true], [1089, 1090, true], [1222, 1223, true], [1300, 1301, true], [1458, 1459, true], [1527, 1528, true], [1670, 1671, true], [1776, 1777, true], [2066, 2067, true], [2212, 2213, true], [2403, 2404, true], [2707, 2708, true]]}, {"id": 23567045, "text": "Lactosylated gramicidin-containing lipid nanoparticles (Lac-GLN) were developed for delivery of anti-microRNA-155 (anti-miR-155) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.

OBJECTIVES: We measured the contents of amino acids in the brain to investigate the mechanisms involved in the pathology of depression. METHODS: LH and non-LH models were subjected to inescapable electric footshocks at random intervals following a conditioned avoidance test to determine acquirement of predicted escape deficits. Tissue amino acid contents in eight brain regions were measured via high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The non-LH model showed increased GABA levels in the dentate gyrus and nucleus accumbens and increased glutamine levels in the dentate gyrus and the orbitofrontal cortex. The LH model had reduced glutamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex. Changes in the ratios of GABA, glutamine, and glutamate were detected in the non-LH model, but not in the LH model. Reductions in threonine levels occurred in the medial prefrontal cortex in both models, whereas elevated alanine levels were detected in the medial prefrontal cortex in non-LH animals.

METHODS: Rats were administered 1.0\u00a0mg/kg intravenous cocaine and placed into a distinctive environment either immediately or 15-min after injection, alternating daily with pairings of a second environment with saline. After four drug-place and four saline-place pairings, rats were returned to their home cages for 1, 7, or 21\u00a0days after which a 15-min place preference test was conducted.

These droplets carry electrical charges, located on the ionic end groups of the macromolecules. We used time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering to determine their size distribution.

The pleura did not reveal any increase in collagen fibers. Only a slight increase in reticulin fibers in the alveolar walls in animals of the 0.5 and 2.5mg/m(3) concentration group was noted. In the 0.1mg/m(3) group, the only animal revealing minimal granulomas exhibited a minimal increase in collagen within the granuloma. No increase in reticulin was observed. Electron microscopy demonstrated entangled MWCNTs within alveolar macrophages. Occasionally electron dense particles/detritus were observed within membrane-bound vesicles (interpreted as phagosomes), which could represent degraded MWCNTs. If so, MWCNTs were degradable by alveolar macrophages and not persistent within the lung. Inhalation of MWCNTs caused granulomatous inflammation within the lung parenchyma but not the pleura in any of the concentration groups. Thus, there are some similarities to effects caused by inhaled asbestos, but the hallmark effects, namely pleural inflammation and/or fibrosis leading to mesotheliomas, are absent.", "anno": [[181, 182, true], [219, 220, true], [453, 454, true], [650, 651, true], [796, 797, true], [855, 856, true], [988, 989, true], [1121, 1122, true], [1160, 1161, true], [1239, 1240, true], [1399, 1400, true], [1489, 1490, true], [1626, 1627, true], [1807, 1808, true]]}]}
