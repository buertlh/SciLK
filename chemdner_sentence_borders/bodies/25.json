This pathology, together with other inflammatory contributions, leads to airway obstruction and breathing complications. Newer therapeutic approaches are of increased interest, including the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Retrospective studies have shown that statins are effective in reducing patient mortality and blood cytokines levels. These findings suggest statins may also provide a new therapeutic approach in COPD treatment. PURPOSE: The aim of the present work was to study the transport of SV across Calu-3 epithelial cells and to investigate its pharmacological action with respect to reduction in mucus production. METHODS: Calu-3 cells were grown under liquid covered culture (LCC) conditions for transport studies in order to demonstrate the ability of SV to transport across the monolayer. For mucus detection, cells were grown under air interface culture (AIC) conditions. Samples collected for microscope analysis were stained with alcian blue; images of the stained cell surface were acquired and the mucus was quantified as the RGBB ratio. RESULTS: SV was transported through the cell monolayer and 'retained' inside the Calu-3 cells. Colour analysis of stained Calu-3 monolayers microscope-images showed that chronic administration of SV for 14days caused a significant inhibition in mucus production. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that local delivery of SV directly to the lungs may provide a promising treatment and potential disease management approach of COPD, with significant effects on mucus reduction.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [99, 100, true], [220, 221, true], [327, 328, true], [445, 446, true], [539, 540, true], [548, 549, true], [733, 734, true], [742, 743, true], [911, 912, true], [995, 996, true], [1165, 1166, true], [1174, 1175, true], [1260, 1261, true], [1428, 1429, true], [1440, 1441, true], [1641, 1642, true]]}, {"id": 23474386, "text": "A series of novel 5-(benzyloxy)pyridin-2(1H)-ones were designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated for c-Met inhibition.

We find that the SWCNT displays a general preference over the PRM in binding with SH3 domain in all the three force fields examined, although the degree of preference can be somewhat different, with the AMBER force field showing the highest preference. The SWCNT prevents the ligand from reaching its native binding pocket by (i) occupying the binding pocket directly, and (ii) binding with the ligand itself and then being trapped together onto some off-sites.

Methods: All cases of C-PTC, FV-PTC and FTC larger than 1 cm in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Cancer Database from 1988 to 2007 were identified. Tumor behavior and patient survival were compared among these three groups. Different risk factors for disease-specific mortality in each group were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Results: A total over 36,000 surgical cases were identified including 21,796 C-PTCs, 10,740 FV-PTCs and 3,958 FTCs. Extrathyroidal extension and lymph node metastases were more common in FV-PTC than in FTC, but significantly less common than in C-PTC (p<0.0001). Distant metastasis rate were present in 2% of patients with FV-PTC, 1% in C-PTC and 4% in FTC (p<0.0001). The 10-year disease-specific survival for patients with FV-PTC was 98%, similar to C-PTC (97%), but better than FTC (94%, p<0.0001).

As the Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (Jak2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway has been shown to be functionally associated with ErbB receptors, we asked if this pathway could mediate P-Rex1/Rac1 activation in response to ErbB ligands. Here we found that the anticancer agent cucurbitacin I, a Jak2 inhibitor, reduced the activation of Rac1 and motility in response to the ErbB3 ligand heregulin in breast cancer cells. However, Rac1 activation was not affected by Jak2 or Stat3 RNA interference, suggesting that the effect of cucurbitacin I occurs through a Jak2-independent mechanism. Cucurbitacin I also failed to affect the activation of P-Rex1 by heregulin. Subsequent analysis revealed that cucurbitacin I strongly activates RhoA and the Rho effector Rho kinase (ROCK) in breast cancer cells and induces the formation of stress fibers. Interestingly, disruption of the RhoA-ROCK pathway prevented the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation by heregulin. Lastly, we found that RhoA activation by cucurbitacin I is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS scavenger N-acetyl l-cysteine and the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO rescued the inhibitory effect of cucurbitacin I on Rac1 activation.

Recent evidence indicates that not only blockade but also activation of 5-HT6 receptors exerts procognitive effects. Nevertheless, little is known about the potential efficacy of 5-HT6 receptor agonists in models of schizophrenia-like cognitive deficits. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the 5-HT6 receptor agonist, EMD 386088, on the ketamine-induced deficits in the attentional set-shifting task (ASST), novel object recognition (NOR) task and prepulse inhibition (PPI) task in rats. Acute administration of EMD 386088 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) to Sprague-Dawley rats reversed the deficit in the ASST induced by repeated ketamine administration. Moreover, the ketamine-induced deficit in the NOR task was ameliorated by EMD 386088 at a dose of 5 mg/kg. However, in contrast to the antipsychotic drug clozapine, the 5-HT6 agonist did not affect PPI disrupted by ketamine. The present study demonstrated the beneficial effects of the 5-HT6 agonist in ameliorating some of the ketamine-induced deficits relevant to schizophrenia.

Recent research has shown that the cellular action and metabolism of SNOs and H2O2 involve overlapping, thiol-based mechanisms, but how these reactive species may affect each other's fate and function is not well understood. In this study we investigated how NO/SNO may affect the redox cycle of mammalian peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx1), a representative of the 2-Cys Prxs, a group of thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent peroxidases. We found that, both in a cell-free system and in cells, NO/SNO donors such as S-nitrosocysteine and S-nitrosoglutathione readily induced the S-nitrosylation of Prx1, causing structural and functional alterations. In particular, nitrosylation promoted disulfide formation involving the pair of catalytic cysteines (Cys-52 and Cys-173) and disrupted the oligomeric structure of Prx1, leading to loss of peroxidase activity. A highly potent inhibition of the peroxidase catalytic reaction by NO/SNO was seen in assays employing the coupled Prx-Trx system. In this setting, S-nitrosocysteine (10 \u03bcm) effectively blocked the Trx-mediated regeneration of oxidized Prx1. This effect appeared to be due to both competition between S-nitrosocysteine and Prx1 for the Trx system and direct modulation by S-nitrosocysteine of Trx reductase activity.

It was also observed that the molecular weights of the three sequences did not affect trans-scleral transport, neither in passive, nor in current assisted permeation. Furthermore, increasing the current intensity from 1.75mA to 3mA, no effect on the trans-scleral transport of the 24-mer was noticed.

RESULTS: The pooled analysis included 4168 patients exposed to alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg daily for 2023 patient-years compared to 691 patients treated with placebo for 263 patient-years and 1169 patients treated with other antidiabetic agents (metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones) for 703 patient-years.

The rotation of the planet on its axis and its revolution around the sun cause predictable daily and seasonal patterns in day length. In order to successfully anticipate and adapt to these patterns in the environment, a variety of biological processes oscillate with a daily rhythm approximately 24 h in length. These rhythms arise from hierarchally-coupled cellular clocks generated by positive and negative transcription factors of core circadian clock gene expression. From these endogenous cellular clocks, overt rhythms in activity and patterns in hormone secretion and other homeostatic processes emerge. These circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior can be organized by a variety of cues, but they are most potently entrained by light. In recent history, there has been a major change from naturally occurring light cycles set by the sun, to artificial and sometimes erratic light cycles determined by the use of electric lighting. Virtually every individual living in an industrialized country experiences light at night (LAN), but despite its prevalence, the biological effects of such unnatural lighting have not been fully considered. Using female Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), we investigated the effects of chronic nightly exposure to dim light on daily rhythms in locomotor activity, serum cortisol concentrations, and brain expression of circadian clock proteins (i.e., PER1, PER2, BMAL1). Although locomotor activity remained entrained to the light cycle, the diurnal fluctuation of cortisol concentrations was blunted and the expression patterns of clock proteins in the SCN and hippocampus were altered.

Sequential chromatin IP uncovered the glut3-(m)CpGs to bind Mecp2 exponentially upon recruitment of Creb1 rather than histone deacetylase 1.

The ECD spectra of the two enantiomers of nicotine were equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, while the UV absorption spectra were coincidental. In line with previous observations, (S)-nicotine exhibited a negative cotton effect centered on 263\u2009nm with vibronic structure (\u03c0-\u03c01 * transition) and a broad, positive ECD signal at around 240\u2009nm associated with the n-\u03c01 * transition. As expected this band disappeared when the pyridyl aromatic moiety was protonated. Four further electronic transitions are reported between 215 and 180\u2009nm; it is proposed the negative maxima around 206\u2009nm is either an n-\u03c3* transition or a charge transfer band resulting from the movement of charge from the pyrrolidyl N lone pair to the pyridyl \u03c0* orbital. The pyridyl \u03c0-\u03c02 * transition may be contained within the negative ECD signal envelope at around 200\u2009nm. Another negative maximum at 188\u2009nm is thought to be the pyridyl \u03c0-\u03c03 * transition, while the lowest wavelength end-absorption and positive ECD may be associated with the \u03c0-\u03c04 * transition.

Peony seed might be a useful resource in developing new herbal or food products.", "anno": [[505, 506, true], [646, 647, true], [708, 709, true], [795, 796, true], [979, 980, true], [1099, 1100, true], [1180, 1181, true]]}, {"id": 23497866, "text": "Response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimise the extraction conditions for flavonoids from fructus sophorae with advantages in terms of resisting flavonoids during the whole process and maximising of extraction yield. Three aglycon forms of the flavonoids, namely, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) to estimate extraction yield. The combined effects of independent variables were studied and the optimal extraction conditions were obtained as ethanol concentration, 74.47%; solid-liquid ratio, 17.99 ml/g; temperature, 89.13\u00b0C; and extraction time, 2.10h. The reliability of the method was confirmed by recovery experiments, performed under optimal conditions. Recoveries indicated that flavonoids resisted the extraction conditions. The experimental extraction yield under optimal conditions was found to be 10.459%, which was well matched with the predicted values of 10.461%.", "anno": [[272, 273, true], [483, 484, true], [710, 711, true], [815, 816, true], [888, 889, true], [1033, 1034, true]]}]}
