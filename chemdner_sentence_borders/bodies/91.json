Tablets consisting of acetaminophen (20-30%), lactose (69.07-78.93%) and magnesium stearate (0.93-1.07%) were prepared in a continuous direct compression line that consisted of two loss-in-weight feeders, one for acetaminophen and one for premixed lactose and magnesium stearate, and a continuous mixer followed by a rotary tablet press. NIR spectroscopy was applied to the continuous mixer and tablet press to perform a 100% product check at full tableting speed. The UV-spectrophotometric method was used as an off-line reference method to determine the acetaminophen content in the samples. The powder mixture and tablet samples were taken during the process for the calibration of continuous mixer and tablet press, respectively. For the continuous mixer, model creation with the PLS method yielded R-Square and RMSEC (root mean square error of calibration) values of 0.975% and 0.56%, respectively. For the tablet press, the corresponding R-Square and RMSEC values were 0.943% and 0.75%, respectively. A test run demonstrated good predictability in the estimation of the API content in the powder mixtures and tablets during the continuous tableting process. For the continuous mixer and tablet press, the RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) values were 0.96% and 1.37%, respectively. This study demonstrates that an NIR instrument capable of fast spectra acquisition can be a valuable tool for the in-line monitoring of the continuous mixing and tableting processes.", "anno": [[117, 118, true], [238, 239, true], [415, 416, true], [753, 754, true], [880, 881, true], [1009, 1010, true], [1149, 1150, true], [1319, 1320, true], [1422, 1423, true], [1579, 1580, true], [1714, 1715, true], [1897, 1898, true]]}, {"id": 23314053, "text": "Bacterial cell division occurs in conjunction with the formation of a cytokinetic Z-ring structure comprised of FtsZ subunits.

Similar phenotypes were also observed in compound mutant mice, where signaling activities of Hh and BMP were genetically manipulated. Single-cell quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed heterogeneity of perichondrial cells in terms of natural characteristics and responsiveness to Hh input. In vitro analyses revealed that Hh signaling suppressed BMP-induced chondrogenic differentiation; Gli1 inhibited the expression of Sox5, Sox6, and Sox9 (SRY box-containing gene 9) as well as transactivation by Sox9. Indeed, ectopic expression of chondrocyte maker genes were observed in the perichondrium of metatarsals in Gli1(-/-) fetuses, and the phenotype was more severe in Gli1(-/-);Gli2(-/-) newborns.

Exposure of mussels to Hg(2+) resulted in failure of redox homeostasis, as reflected on lipid peroxidation levels and superoxide dismutase activity in glands, and micronucleus frequency in gills. Extracts from digestive glands after 15-day exposure to Hg(2+) exhibited decreased tRNA aminoacylation ability and, moreover, a 70% reduction in the ability of 40S ribosomal subunits to form the 48S initiation ribosomal complex. A similar reduction was detected in the ability of ribosomes to translocate peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site, an observation coinciding with the notion that regulation of protein synthesis by Hg(2+) mainly occurs at the initiation and elongation stages of translation.

The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of XXMD for acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in 6 databases until June 2012 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of XXMD for acute ischemic stroke compared with western conventional medicine (WCM). The primary outcome measures were National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. The secondary outcome measures were the clinical effective rate and adverse events at the end of treatment course. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed independently using 12-item criteria according to the Cochrane Back Review Group. All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.0 software. RESULTS: Eight RCTs with 601 individuals published from 1992 to 2012 were identified. The studies were deemed to have a high risk of bias. Compared with WCM, 1 RCT showed significant effects of XXMD for improving mRS after stroke (p<0.05); 3 RCTs for improving NIHSS scores [n=186, weighted mean difference (WMD): -1.86, 95% CI: -3.25 to -0.48, z=2.63, p<0.01]; 7 RCTs for improving the clinical effective rate [n=531, risk ratio (RR)=1.17, 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.26, z=4.38, p<0.01]. Five trials contained safety assessments and stated that no adverse event was found, whereas the other 3 trials did not provide the information about adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed positive but weak evidence of XXMD for acute ischemic stroke because of the poor methodological quality and the small quantity of the included trials. The difficulties of fitting Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) into the double blinded RCTs have raised as follows: (A) traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as whole systems of healthcare offers unique methodological and theoretical challenges for RCTs; (B) suspicions against the placebo and unwillingness to stop taking other CHMs make recruitment more difficulty, time-consumption, and cost; (C) the shortcomings of the TCM diagnostic process includes the lack of standardization in terminology, disagreement of pattern differentiation (Bianzheng), and neglect of formula corresponding to syndrome (TCM Zheng); (D) It is difficult to design credible herbal placebos with similar appearance, smells and tastes to the experimental CHM and at the same time is absent of any pharmacological activity; (E) the achieving efficacy of CHM complex interventions is often nonspecific and the outcome measures is subjective using Chinese quantitative instrument.", "anno": [[30, 31, true], [152, 153, true], [252, 253, true], [275, 276, true], [484, 485, true], [616, 617, true], [731, 732, true], [861, 862, true], [919, 920, true], [928, 929, true], [1005, 1006, true], [1058, 1059, true], [1399, 1400, true], [1565, 1566, true], [1578, 1579, true], [1759, 1760, true], [2707, 2708, true]]}, {"id": 23640331, "text": "Steroid receptors were classically described for regulating transcription by binding to target gene promoters.

We found that in response to hormone treatment, the PR is recruited to these sites along with two histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and GCN5, leading to an increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation and to the binding of the SWI/SNF complex. Concomitant, a more relaxed chromatin was detected along bcl-x gene mainly in the regions surrounding the intragenic PRbs. PR also mediated the recruitment of the positive elongation factor pTEFb, favoring RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation activity.

In the present study we provide new evidence for such a role and identify additional cellular components responsible for it.

We now show that lysosomal enlargement and zinc build-up in TRPML1-KD cells exposed to zinc are ameliorated by KD of the zinc-sensitive transcription factor MTF-1 (metal-regulatory-element-binding transcription factor-1) or the zinc transporter ZnT4. TRPML1 KD is associated with a build-up of cytoplasmic zinc and with enhanced transcriptional response of mRNA for MT2a (metallothionein 2a). TRPML1 KD did not suppress lysosomal secretion, but it did delay zinc leak from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm. These results underscore a role for TRPML1\u00a0in zinc metabolism.

The median for all pregnant women in NHANES 2005-2010 was less than adequate (129 \u00b5g/L), the third trimester women had UI concentrations that were adequate ( median UI 172 \u00b5g/L). Third trimester women participating in the NCS study similarly had an adequate level of iodine intake, with a median UI concentration of 167\u00b5g/L.

Conclusions: Dairy, but not salt, seafood or grain consumption, was significantly positively associated with median UI concentration in women of childbearing age. Pregnant women in their third trimester in the NHANES 2005-2010 had adequate median UI concentrations, but pregnant women in NHANES who were in their first or second trimesters had median UI concentrations that were less than adequate.

Since the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood, we addressed this issue employing primary cultures of mouse mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons.

These effects were blocked by mecamylamine and dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine, but not methyllycaconitine. The involvement of \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR was supported by the lack of nicotine-induced structural remodeling in neurons from \u03b14 null mutant mice (KO). Challenge with nicotine triggered phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the thymoma viral proto-oncogene (Akt) followed by activation of the mTORC1-dependent p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase. Upstream pathway blockade using the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 resulted in suppression of nicotine-induced phosphorylations and structural plasticity.

However, the more recent RECOORD refinement study of CI2 yielded predictions comparable to the X-ray and homology model-based analyses.", "anno": [[185, 186, true], [349, 350, true], [543, 544, true], [746, 747, true], [834, 835, true], [1037, 1038, true], [1209, 1210, true], [1345, 1346, true]]}, {"id": 23411319, "text": "Galicia (N.W. Spain) is a Spanish region with several old-traditional winegrowing areas. There are autochthonous grapevine varieties, such as Vitis vinifera L. cv. Mourat\u00f3n, considered a biodiversity resource in viticulture and an opportunity for Galician sustainable wine production. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the potential of traditional cultivars to produce quality red wines. In this work, anthocyanin and flavonol evolution was followed in red berries from V. vinifera L. cv. Mourat\u00f3n. The novelty of this study is that grapes were separately collected from two different positions (tips and shoulders) within the cluster, over ripening to examine the effects of berry position within the fruit cluster on the flavonoid compounds. Derivatives of five anthocyanins (malvidin, peonidin, petunidin, delphinidin and cyanidin) and derivatives of six flavonols (quercetin, myricetin, kaempherol, laricitrin isorhamnetin and syringetin) were detected in both positions within the cluster. Dynamic of anthocyanins (from 819 mg/kg to 1206 mg/kg in tips; and from 786 mg/kg to 1077 mg/kg in shoulders) and dynamic of flavonols (from 25mg/kg to 41 mg/kg in tips; and from 18 mg/kg to 21 mg/kg in shoulders) confirmed their upward trends over ripening. Grapes located inside the shoulder bunch receive less sunlight radiation than those located inside the tip bunch and this fact could explain the different accumulation observed for both positions. These results can be useful for winemakers in order to obtain different final red wine quality.", "anno": [[87, 88, true], [283, 284, true], [389, 390, true], [500, 501, true], [745, 746, true], [996, 997, true], [1255, 1256, true], [1452, 1453, true], [1548, 1549, true]]}, {"id": 23541434, "text": "The neuromuscular activity of Bbil-TX, a PLA2 with catalytic activity isolated from Bothriopsis bilineata smargadina venom, was examined in chick biventer cervicis (BC) and mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm (PND) preparations. In BC preparations, Bbil-TX (0.5-10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) caused time- and concentration-dependent blockade that was not reversed by washing; the times for 50% blockade were 87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07, 41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 and 19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0min (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM; n\u00a0=\u00a04-6) for 1, 5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively. Muscle contractures to exogenous ACh and KCl were unaffected. The toxin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) also did not affect the twitch-tension of directly-stimulated, curarized (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) BC preparations. However, Bbil-TX (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) produced mild morphological alterations (edematous and/or hyperchromic fibers) in BC; there was also a progressive release of CK (from 116\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0IU/ml (basal) to 710\u00a0\u00b1\u00a091\u00a0IU/ml after 45\u00a0min). Bbil-TX (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml)-induced blockade was markedly inhibited at 22-24\u00a0\u00b0C and pretreatment with p-bromophenacyl bromide (p-BPB) abolished the neuromuscular blockade. Bbil-TX (3-30\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, n\u00a0=\u00a04-6) caused partial time- and concentration-dependent blockade in PND preparations (52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% at the highest concentration). Bbil-TX (30\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) also markedly reduced the MEPPs frequency [from 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5 (basal) to 10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 after 60\u00a0min; n\u00a0=\u00a05; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05] and the quantal content [from 94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 (basal) to 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 after 60\u00a0min; n\u00a0=\u00a05; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05] of PND preparations, but caused only minor depolarization of the membrane resting potential [from -80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mV (basal) to -66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mV after 120\u00a0min; n\u00a0=\u00a05; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05], with no significant change in the depolarizing response to exogenous carbachol.

Copper, chrome, iron and zinc were detected in the gills of both species, and aldrin/dieldrin, endosulfan and heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide were detected in the gills of fish from all of the sites, with the exception of FU10. Fish collected at FU20, FU30 and FU50 exhibited numerous alterations in the surface architecture of their pavement cells and MRCs. The surface MRC density and MRC fractional area were lower in fish from FU20, FU30, FU40 and FU50 than in those from the reference site (FU10) in the winter, and some variability between the sites was observed in the summer. The organochlorine contamination at FU20 and FU50 was associated with variable changes in the MRCs and inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) activity, especially in P. maculatus. At FU30, the alterations in the MRCs were associated with the contaminants present, especially metals. A multivariate analysis demonstrated a positive association between the biological responses of both species and environmental contamination, indicating that under realistic conditions, a mixture of organochlorines and metals affected the MRCs by inhibiting NKA activity and inducing morphological changes, which may cause an ionic imbalance.", "anno": [[348, 349, true], [562, 563, true], [788, 789, true], [919, 920, true], [1144, 1145, true], [1323, 1324, true], [1426, 1427, true], [1769, 1770, true]]}]}
