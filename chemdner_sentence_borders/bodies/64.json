Prostate cancer chemoprevention is one potential avenue to alleviate these burdens. It is a regime whereby long-term treatments are intended to prevent or arrest cancer development, in contrast to more direct intervention upon disease diagnosis. Based on this intention, cancer chemoprevention generally focuses on the use of nontoxic chemical agents which are well-tolerated for prolonged usage that is necessary to address prostate cancer's multistage and lengthy period of progression. One such nontoxic natural agent is the flavonoid silibinin, derived from the milk thistle plant (Silybum marianum), which has ancient medicinal usage and potent antioxidant activity. Based on these properties, silibinin has been investigated in a host of cancer models where it exhibits broad-spectrum efficacy against cancer progression both in vitro and in vivo without noticeable toxicity. Specifically in prostate cancer models, silibinin has shown the ability to modulate cell signaling, proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, which taken together provides strong support for silibinin as a candidate prostate cancer chemopreventive agent.", "anno": [[262, 263, true], [346, 347, true], [508, 509, true], [751, 752, true], [934, 935, true], [1144, 1145, true], [1461, 1462, true]]}, {"id": 23422298, "text": "Kynurenic acid (KYNA), one of the main product of the kynurenine pathway originating from tryptophan, is considered to be neuroprotective. Dysregulation of KYNA activity is thought to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases, the physiopathology of which evokes excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and/or protein aggregation. The neuroprotective effect of KYNA is generally attributed to its antagonistic action on NMDA receptors. However, this single target action appears insufficient to support KYNA beneficial effects against complex neurodegenerative processes including neuroinflammation, \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) toxicity and apoptosis. Novel insights are therefore required to elucidate KYNA neuroprotective mechanisms. Here, we combined cellular, biochemical, molecular and pharmacological approaches to demonstrate that low micromolar concentrations of KYNA strongly induce neprilysin (NEP) gene expression, protein level and enzymatic activity increase in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, our studies revealed that KYNA exerts a protective effect on SH-SY5Y cells by increasing their viability through a mechanism independent from NMDA receptors. Interestingly, KYNA also induced NEP activity and neuroprotection in mouse cortical neuron cultures the viability of which was more promoted than SH-SY5Y cell survival under KYNA treatment. KYNA-evoked neuroprotection disappeared in the presence of thiorphan, an inhibitor of NEP activity. NEP is a well characterized metallopeptidase whose deregulation leads to cerebral A\u03b2 accumulation and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease.

We describe male sexual behaviour in relation to changes in anogenital swelling size, timing of ovulation and female socio-sexual behaviour in wild Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). We further compare male sexual behaviour during conception and post-conception cycles to evaluate if males differentiate between these qualitatively different cycle types. Our results show that during conception cycles male mating behaviour was concentrated around the fertile phase implying that males inferred information from more than swelling size alone. Male mating frequency increased in line with female socio-sexual behaviour, namely female presenting and the frequency of copulations with copulation calls.

In the present study, using murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) from Rab27-deficient mutant mice, we found that, in contrast to Rab27b, Rab27a primarily plays an inhibitory role in regulating degranulation. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that resting Rab27a-deficient (ashen) BMMCs display abnormal cortical F-actin distribution. Actin disassembly prior to IgE cross-linking increased wild-type BMMC secretion to ashen levels, suggesting that changes in the integrity of cortical F-actin underlie the ashen phenotype. Comparison of the secretory impairment of Rab27b knockout and Rab27a/b double knockout BMMCs highlighted a secondary positive role for Rab27a in enhancing degranulation. Rab27 is known to interact with actin via its effectors melanophilin (Mlph) and myosin\u00a0Va (MyoVa) in other cell types. To better understand the differing roles of Rab27 proteins, we analysed the secretory phenotype of BMMCs derived from mice lacking Rab27 effector proteins.

In addition, antifungal activity was assessed using agar-diffusion and time-kill curves. The drug efflux activity was determined using two dyes, Rhodamine6G (R6G) and fluorescent Hoechst 33342. No significant differences were observed in dye uptakes between FLC-susceptible and resistant isolates, incubated in glucose free buffer. However, a significantly higher efflux was recorded in FLC-resistant isolates when glucose was added. Both monoterpenes inhibited efflux by 70-90%, showing their high potency to block drug transporter pumps. Significant differences, in the expression levels of CDR1 and MDR1, induced by monoterpenes revealed reversal of FLC-resistance.

However, this mechanism does not explain the hydrolysis of activated esters. In this work, we have used ab initio calculations, continuum solvation models and ab initio classical trajectory to support the WAIA mechanism for normal ester. In the case of activated esters, the process can also be viewed as water autoionization with formation of hydroxide ion aided by a second water moleculeacting as a general base (WAIB mechanism). This is the mechanism proposed by Jencks and Carriuolo fifty years ago. Our analysis point out that the usual method for exploring mechanisms, searching for saddle points, may not work for problems like the present one, since there are no saddle points on the reaction pathway. Rather, the formation of a pair of ions from a neutral species may have an asymptotic barrier.

The anomalous temperature dependence of KIEs is often rationalized by invoking fast motions to facilitate H-transfer, yet crucially, direct evidence for coupled motions is lacking. The fast motions hypothesis underpinning the temperature dependence of KIEs is based on inference.

Knockdown of PHF6 impairs cell proliferation and arrests cells at G(2)/M phase, which is accompanied by an increased level of phosphorylated H2AX, indicating that PHF6 deficiency leads to the accumulation of DNA damage in the cell. We found that increased DNA damage occurs at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus in PHF6-deficient cells.

Many synapses are also surrounded by astrocytic processes and embedded in conspicuous extracellular matrix (ECM). It is now widely recognized that astrocytes play a central role in regulating the synaptic machinery by exchanging information with the neuronal elements via diffusible molecules and direct physical interactions; this has lead to the concept of the 'tri-partite synapse'.

According to the inflammatory stress hypothesis, the effects of inflammation interact with the effects of a drug or its reactive metabolite, precipitating toxic reactions in the liver. As a follow-up to our recently published mouse precision-cut liver slices model, an ex vivo model involving human precision-cut liver slices (hPCLS), co-incubated for 24 h with IDILI-related drugs and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was developed to study IDILI mechanisms related to inflammatory stress in humans and to detect potential biomarkers. LPS exacerbated the effects of ketoconazole and clozapine toxicity but not those of their non-IDILI-related comparators, voriconazole and olanzapine. However, the IDILI-related drugs diclofenac, carbamazepine, and troglitazone did not show synergistic toxicity with LPS after incubation for 24 h.

RESULTS: Fractionated bulb extracts and the two isolated steroidal glycoalkaloids (1) and (2) induced NO production and TGF-\u03b2 receptor I mRNA expression in fibroblast cell culture. In a cytotoxicity assay, steroidal glycosides (1) and (3) had IC50 values of 8.2 and 8.7\u00b5M, but the natural acetylation of the C-6\u2033' hydroxy of the terminal glucose unit in (2) resulted in a 3-fold decrease in cell cytotoxicity when compared with (1). Results from the dermal fibroblast migration assay revealed that the steroidal glycoalkaloids (1) and (2), and the furostanol saponin (3) promoted fibroblast migration from the range of 23.7\u00b15.7 to 37.7\u00b15.1%, as compared with the control. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data demonstrate that the steroidal glycosides present in Easter lily bulbs induce, at least in part, the observed dermal fibroblast migration activity of the bulb extracts. This is the first evidence that steroidal glycosides from L. longiflorum may potentially play a role in the wound healing process and may provide a scientific basis for the historical use of lily bulbs for this purpose.", "anno": [[30, 31, true], [239, 240, true], [257, 258, true], [454, 455, true], [477, 478, true], [740, 741, true], [807, 808, true], [1010, 1011, true], [1019, 1020, true], [1191, 1192, true], [1443, 1444, true], [1682, 1683, true], [1694, 1695, true], [1886, 1887, true], [2106, 2107, true]]}, {"id": 23415902, "text": "Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) activates FSH receptors (FSHR) in granulosa cells to induce follicle differentiation, growth and estradiol production.

To this end, a survey and a pan-European external quality assessment (EQA) were implemented. This report is the summary of the results of that trial. With the European Federation of Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) support, 124 applications for participation in the trial were received from 27 different European countries, and 102 laboratories actually participated in the trial. Each participating laboratory described their respective laboratory policies and practices as well as blood collection tubes typically used in performing this type of testing. The participating laboratories received two identical blood specimens: in an EDTA tubes (unstabilized blood; n=67) or in tubes designed specifically for the stabilization of intracellular RNA in blood (PAXgene\u00ae Blood RNA tubes; n=35). Laboratories were requested to perform RNA extraction according to the laboratory's own procedure as soon as possible upon receipt of the tubes for one tube and 24h after the first extraction for the second tube. Participants (n=93) returned the two extracted RNAs to SPIDIA facility for analysis, and provided details about the reagents and protocols they used for the extraction. At the SPIDIA facility responsible for coordinating the study, the survey data were classified, and the extracted RNA samples were evaluated for purity, yield, integrity, stability, and the presence of interfering substances affecting RT-qPCR assays. All participants received a report comparing the performance of the RNA they submitted to that of the other participants. All the results obtained by participants for each RNA quality parameter were classified as \"in control\", \"warning\", \"out of control\" and \"missing\" by consensus mean analysis. From the survey data, the most variable parameters were the volume of blood collected and the time and storage temperature between blood collection and RNA extraction. Analyzing the results of quality testing of submitted RNA samples we observed a data distribution of purity, yield, and presence of assay interference in agreement with expected values. The RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values distribution was, on the other hand, much wider than the optimal expected value, which led to an \"in control\" classification, even for partly degraded RNA samples. On the other hand, RIN values below 5 significantly correlated with a reduction of GAPDH expression levels. Furthermore, the distribution of the values of the four transcripts investigated (c-fos, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and GAPDH) was wide and the RNA instability between samples separated by 24h were similar. Assuming the presence of at least two quality parameters \"out of control\" as an indication of a critical performance of the laboratory, 33% of the laboratories were included in this group.

The model estimated acute and chronic HBV infections, complications, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Data sources included surveillance data, epidemiological studies, and vaccine prices. RESULTS With a 10% uptake rate, the intervention will vaccinate 528,047 people and prevent 4,271 acute and 256 chronic hepatitis B infections. Net health care costs will increase by $91.4 million, and 1,218 QALYs will be gained, producing a cost-effectiveness ratio of $75,094 per QALY gained. Results are most sensitive to age, the discount rate, the hepatitis B incidence ratio for people with diabetes, and hepatitis B infection rates. Cost-effectiveness ratios rise with age at vaccination; an alternative intervention that vaccinates adults with diabetes 60 years of age or older had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $2.7 million per QALY. CONCLUSIONS Hepatitis B vaccination for adults with diabetes 20-59 years of age is modestly cost-effective. Vaccinating older adults with diabetes is not cost-effective.

The potential of a drug to engage in such interactions may be assessed in in vitro systems such as precision-cut tissue slices. 2.Precision-cut tissue slices have a number of important advantages compared with the use of cells in culture, especially when tissues with a heterogeneous cellular population are concerned. 3.Extensive studies concerned with the induction of cytochrome P450 and Phase II enzymes in precision-cut tissue slices from various animal and human tissues, such as liver, lung and intestine, using established inducing agents have revealed that slices mimic the in vivo situation. 4.Precision-cut tissue slices is a reliable, informative and cost-effective technique for assessing the potential of chemicals to up-regulate drug-metabolising enzyme systems.", "anno": [[109, 110, true], [237, 238, true], [428, 429, true], [711, 712, true], [887, 888, true]]}, {"id": 22998295, "text": "In the present study, we prepared an inclusion complex of methotrexate (MTX) with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) in order to decrease its photosensitivity and enhance its aqueous solubility. Then we incorporated this inclusion complex in a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) overall to increase its oral bioavailability. The inclusion complex has been prepared by freeze drying method and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ultraviolet (UV), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy assays. The proper molecular ratio of MTX/\u03b2-CD was found to be of 1:7, and the water-solubility of MTX was increased in an average of 10-fold. The photostability studies showed that the MTX became stable on exposure to light. Construction of pseudoternary diagrams were investigated to prepare a MTX/\u03b2-CD inclusion complex loaded SMEDDS which was characterized by measuring the particle size and the zeta-potential. The optimum formulation of SMEDDS was a system consisting of ethyl oleate, tween 80, and propylene glycol with a mean droplet size of 39.42\u2009nm. In vitro drug release in different pH media showed that the release profile of MTX from the MTX/\u03b2-CD loaded SMEDDS was influenced by the pH of the release medium and presented the characteristics of a sustained release profile. Finally, in-vivo studies showed an enhancement of the bioavailability of MTX from the MTX/\u03b2-CD loaded SMEDDS form of 1.57-fold. We concluded that the \u03b2-CD inclusion complex loaded SMEDDS improved the chemical and physiological properties of MTX and could be a promising means for the delivery of MTX and other unstable and lipophilic drugs by oral route.", "anno": [[180, 181, true], [327, 328, true], [510, 511, true], [645, 646, true], [728, 729, true], [918, 919, true], [1062, 1063, true], [1290, 1291, true], [1418, 1419, true], [1645, 1646, true]]}]}
