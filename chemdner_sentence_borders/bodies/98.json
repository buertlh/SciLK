A significant decrease in HLA-DR expression was observed in the AP and fractionated procyanidin-treated cells in the presence of ovalbumin (OVA), but no effect on CD86 expression was observed. The uptake of OVA was not inhibited by AP treatment, and the gene expression of membrane-associated RING-CH ubiquitin E3 ligase, MARCH1, was up-regulated by AP treatment. It can therefore be presumed that AP suppresses HLA-DR expression via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the up-regulation of IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 was found in the procyanidin trimers-treated cells in the presence of OVA.

However, the molecular mechanism responsible for this alteration remains unknown. We show here repressive epigenetic changes at the promoter region of the mGlu2 gene in frontal cortex of 5-HT2A-KO mice. Disruption of 5-HT2A receptor-dependent signaling in mice was associated with decreased acetylation of histone H3 (H3ac) and H4 (H4ac), and increased tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the mGlu2 promoter-epigenetic changes that correlate with transcriptional repression. Neither methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2/3) nor tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) was affected. We found that Egr1, a transcription factor whose promoter activity was positively regulated by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist TCB-2, binds less to the mGlu2 promoter in frontal cortex of 5-HT2A-KO as compared to wild-type mice.

To explore the molecular basis for CPT hypersensitivity in Top2\u03b2-deficient cells, we found that upon CPT exposure, the RNA polymerase II large subunit (RNAP LS) became progressively depleted, followed by recovery to nearly the original level in wild-type MEFs, whereas RNAP LS remained depleted without recovery in Top2\u03b2-deficient cells.

The serum levels of sPD-L1 and IFN-\u03b3 were determined by ELISA system. T cell proliferation was determined by cocultivation and WST-8 incorporation. RESULTS: In 125 T2DM patients and 48 healthy donors, CD4(+)CD28(-) T cells from patients with T2DM expressed higher PD-1 than that of the cells from healthy individuals, and the proliferation response of CD4(+)CD28(-) T cells could be enhanced by advanced glycation end products (AGEs).

Titanium is among the most widely used medical implant material and quickly forms a TiO2 passivation layer under physiological conditions. Understanding the binding mechanism of Dopa to TiO2 surfaces is therefore of considerable theoretical and practical interest. Using a surface forces apparatus, we explored the force-distance profiles and adhesion energies of mussel foot protein 3 (mfp-3) to TiO2 surfaces at three different pHs (pH 3, 5.5 and 7.5). At pH 3, mfp-3 showed the strongest adhesion force on TiO2, with an adhesion energy of \u223c-7.0 mJ/m(2). Increasing the pH gives rise to two opposing effects: (1) increased oxidation of Dopa, thus, decreasing availability for the Dopa-mediated adhesion, and (2) increased bidentate Dopa-Ti coordination, leading to the further stabilization of the Dopa group and, thus, an increase in adhesion force. Both effects were reflected in the resonance-enhanced Raman spectra obtained at the three deposition pHs. The two competing effects give rise to a higher adhesion force of mfp-3 on the TiO2 surface at pH 7.5 than at pH 5.5.

The results of studies on oocytes show that PKA, NKCC1, P2X3 receptors, and GABA A receptor-associated protein, etc., are existing systems that show different reactivity to the GABA A receptors. The GABA A receptor subunits contain distinct binding sites for BZDs, neurosteroids, general anesthetics, etc., which are responsible for the numerous functions of the GABA A receptor. A variety of other drugs, such as topiramate, TG41, (+)- and (-)-borneol, apigenin, and 6-methylflavone could also have modulatory effects on the GABA A receptors. Some of the different models and hypotheses on GABA A receptor structure and function have been achieved by using the two-electrode voltage clamp method in oocytes.", "anno": [[146, 147, true], [249, 250, true], [430, 431, true], [606, 607, true], [707, 708, true], [777, 778, true], [972, 973, true], [1157, 1158, true], [1321, 1322, true], [1486, 1487, true]]}, {"id": 23578872, "text": "A recent study shows that subordinate rats reduce their rate of sniffing while\u00a0dominants explore their faces thus delaying dominants' subsequent aggression.

Currently, various enzymatic assays are used in the search for AKR1C inhibitors, and consequently the results of different research groups are not necessarily comparable. During our recent search for AKR1C inhibitors, we found a cyclopentanol derivative (2-(4-chlorobenzylidene)cyclopentanol, CBCP-ol) and its respective cyclopentanone counterpart (2-(4-chlorobenzylidene)cyclopentanone, CBCP-one) that acted as AKR1C substrates. We determined the kinetic parameters KM, kcat and kcat/KM for oxidation of CBCP-ol and reduction of CBCP-one by AKR1C enzymes in the presence of NAD(+)/NADP(+) and NADH/NADPH, respectively. The catalytic efficiencies for the oxidation of CBCP-ol in the presence of NAD(+) or NADP(+) were in general higher when compared to the catalytic efficiencies for reduction of CBCP-one in the presence of NADH or NADPH. When NADPH was used, as compared to NADH, the reductions of CBCP-one by AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 were 14-, 51- and 31-fold more efficient, respectively.

The comparison of CBCP-one reduction with NADPH to reductions of physiological substrates revealed in general higher efficiencies, except for reduction of 9-cis-retinaldehyde by AKR1C3.

However, the nature of the signal(s) that initiate carrier biogenesis remains unknown. We examined the specificity and initial sites of recruitment of Arf-dependent adaptors (AP-1 and GGAs) in response to the Golgi or endosomal localization of specific cargo proteins (furin, mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) and M6PR lacking a C-terminal domain M6PR\u0394C).

Cargos do not promote adaptor recruitment to all compartments in which they reside and thus additional factors regulate the cargo's ability to promote Arf activation and adaptor recruitment. We document that within a given compartment different cargos recruit different adaptors suggesting that there is little or no free, activated Arf at the membrane and that Arf activation is spatially and temporally coupled to the cargo and the adaptor. Using temperature block, Brefeldin A, and recovery from each, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of M6PR causes the recruitment of AP-1 and GGAs to recycling endosomes and not at the Golgi, as predicted by steady state staining profiles.

METHODS: Experiment 1 examined the effects of nicotine and methylphenidate on delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) and self-ordered spatial search (SOSS) performances in rhesus monkeys (DMTS: n\u2009=\u20097; SOSS: n\u2009=\u20096) to determine the validity and reliability of best dose effects. Experiment 2 used Monte Carlo computer simulations to estimate the likelihood of obtaining a significant outcome when the best dose method was applied to randomly generated data sets for which no difference existed. RESULTS: Significant effects were obtained when the best dose analysis was applied to performances from nondrug sessions, and best dose performances were not significantly different from the best nondrug performances. The doses identified as best doses from two nicotine dose-response curve determinations were unrelated, and the improvement associated with the best dose observed during the first dose-response curve determination was not reliable when the dose was administered repeatedly.

Mutant PLP1 accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress. However, the link between the clinical severity of PMD and the cellular response induced by mutant PLP1 remains largely unknown. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER generally leads to up-regulation of ER chaperones to alleviate ER stress. Here, we found that expression of the PLP1-A243V mutant, which causes severe disease, depletes some ER chaperones with a KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) motif, in HeLa cells, MO3.13 oligodendrocytic cells, and primary oligodendrocytes. The same PLP1 mutant also induces fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (GA). These organelle changes are less prominent in cells with milder disease-associated PLP1 mutants. Similar changes are also observed in cells expressing another disease-causing gene that triggers ER stress, as well as in cells treated with brefeldin A, which induces ER stress and GA fragmentation by inhibiting GA to ER trafficking. We also found that mutant PLP1 disturbs localization of the KDEL receptor, which transports the chaperones with the KDEL motif from the GA to the ER. These data show that PLP1 mutants inhibit GA to ER trafficking, which reduces the supply of ER chaperones and induces GA fragmentation.

This study was undertaken to document morphometric and functional changes during the 12 months following RI administration in a murine model of RI-induced SG dysfunction. Methods: Female C57BL/6, 4-week-old mice (n=60) were divided into a RI-treated group (n=30) that received RI orally (0.01 mCi/g body weight) or an unexposed control group (n=30). Mice in both groups were divided into five subgroups (n=6 per subgroup) and sacrificed at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-RI administration. Salivary flow rates (SFR) and salivary lag times were measured at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after RI administration. Morphological and histological examinations and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed. In addition, changes in salivary 99m Tc pertechnetate uptake and excretion were observed by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Results: In RI-treated mice, the SGs were significantly lighter compared to unexposed controls at all study time points. Lag times to salivation in the RI-treated group were greater than in the unexposed controls, but mean SFR were lower. Histologic examinations of SGs in the RI-group showed pale cytoplasm, atypical ductal configuration, septal widening, cytoplasmic vacuolization with pleomorphism, lymphocyte infiltration, and increased fibrosis. Furthermore, more apoptotic cells were observed in acini and ducts in the RI group. In addition, patterns of 99m Tc pertechnetate uptake and excretion in the RI-group were quite different from those observed in controls at 1 and 12 months post-RI.

Empirical evidence demonstrates that the Druckrey-K\u00fcpfm\u00fcller toxicity model, which was validated for chemical carcinogens in the early 1960s, is also applicable to a wide range of toxic compounds in ecotoxicology. According to this model, the character of a poison is primarily determined by the reversibility of critical receptor binding. Chemicals showing irreversible or slowly reversible binding to specific receptors will produce cumulative effects with time of exposure, and whenever the effects are also irreversible (e.g. death) they are reinforced over time; these chemical have time-cumulative toxicity. Compounds having non-specific receptor binding, or involving slowly reversible binding to some receptors that do not contribute to toxicity, may also be time-dependent; however, their effects depend primarily on the exposure concentration, with time playing a minor role. Consequently, the mechanism of toxic action has important implications for risk assessment. Traditional risk approaches cannot predict the impacts of toxicants with time-cumulative toxicity in the environment.

Alcoholic ginseng root (200\u2009mg/kg body weight, daily oral gavage) extract was administered to groups of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice for 2 or 4\u2009months. Dysmetabolic state in the diabetic mice was significantly improved by ginseng treatment. In both the heart and retina of diabetic animals, ginseng treatment significantly prevented oxidative stress and diabetes-induced upregulations of extracellular matrix proteins and vasoactive factors. Ginseng treatment in the diabetic animals resulted in enhancement of stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and left ventricle pressure during systole and diastole and diminution of stroke work. In addition, mRNA expressions of atrial natriuretic factor and brain natriuretic factor (molecular markers for cardiac hypertrophy) were significantly diminished in ginseng-treated diabetic mice. These data indicate that North American ginseng prevents the diabetes-induced retinal and cardiac biochemical and functional changes probably through inhibition of oxidative stress.", "anno": [[107, 108, true], [305, 306, true], [468, 469, true], [628, 629, true], [717, 718, true], [918, 919, true], [1124, 1125, true], [1320, 1321, true], [1502, 1503, true]]}, {"id": 23395155, "text": "Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is an antihypertensive, antithrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic molecule. Hypercholesterolemia leads to a reduction in vascular NO bioavailability. This is attributed to a dysfunction of the eNOS enzyme and a reduced eNOS activity. NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress leads to oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the essential cofactor of eNOS. In BH4 deficiency, oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby converting eNOS to a superoxide-producing enzyme. As a consequence of eNOS uncoupling, NO production is reduced and the pre-existing oxidative stress is enhanced, which contribute significantly to atherogenesis. Therefore, pharmacological approaches that prevent eNOS uncoupling and enhance eNOS activity are of therapeutic interest. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers, statins, nebivolol and resveratrol have been shown to reverse eNOS uncoupling and to stimulate eNOS activity concurrently. Molecular mechanisms of the aforementioned drugs/compounds on eNOS functionality is summarized and discussed in this review.", "anno": [[137, 138, true], [211, 212, true], [295, 296, true], [416, 417, true], [539, 540, true], [701, 702, true], [823, 824, true], [1011, 1012, true], [1136, 1137, true]]}]}
