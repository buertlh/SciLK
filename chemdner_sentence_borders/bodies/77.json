We showed previously that amygdala-driven abnormal inhibition and decreased output of mPFC pyramidal cells contribute to pain-related impaired decision-making (Ji et al., 2010). Therefore, modulating pyramidal output is desirable therapeutic goal. Targeting metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 has emerged as a cognitive-enhancing strategy in neuropsychiatric disorders, but synaptic and cellular actions of mGluR5 in the mPFC remain to be determined. The present study determined synaptic and cellular actions of mGluR5 to test the hypothesis that increasing mGluR5 function can enhance pyramidal cell output. Whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp recordings were made from visually identified pyramidal neurons in layer V of the mPFC in rat brain slices. Both the prototypical mGluR5 agonist CHPG and a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) for mGluR5 (VU0360172) increased synaptically evoked spiking (E-S coupling) in mPFC pyramidal cells. The facilitatory effects of CHPG and VU0360172 were inhibited by an mGluR5 antagonist (MTEP). CHPG, but not VU0360172, increased neuronal excitability (frequency-current [F-I] function). VU0360172, but not CHPG, increased evoked excitatory synaptic currents (EPSCs) and amplitude, but not frequency, of miniature EPSCs, indicating a postsynaptic action. VU0360172, but not CHPG, decreased evoked inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) through an action that involved cannabinoid receptor CB1, because a CB1 receptor antagonist (AM281) blocked the inhibitory effect of VU0360172 on synaptic inhibition. VU0360172 also increased and prolonged CB1-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of synaptic inhibition (DSI). Activation of CB1 with ACEA decreased inhibitory transmission through a presynaptic mechanism. The results show that increasing mGluR5 function enhances mPFC output. This effect can be accomplished by increasing excitability with an orthosteric agonist (CHPG) or by increasing excitatory synaptic drive and CB1-mediated presynaptic suppression of synaptic inhibition (\"dis-inhibition\") with a PAM (VU0360172). Therefore, mGluR5 may be a useful target in conditions of impaired mPFC output.

The study was conducted on 63 textile workers and 65 nonexposed subjects. Both groups were matched for age, socioeconomic status and smoking habit.

Respiratory complaints were chronic cough (33.2%), chronic bronchitis (39.7%) and dyspnea (23.8%) in textile workers compared to (6.2%, 6.2% and 1.5%), respectively, in controls. There was a marked reduction in the ventilatory functions (forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s) in the textile workers compared to the controls. The additive effect of smoking on the ventilatory functions was not apparent. The ventilatory functions of the workers were significantly positively correlated with the duration of exposure. The cytokines were insignificantly higher in the textile workers compared to their controls. The textile workers with respiratory complaints showed significant decline in ventilatory functions and elevation in the cytokine levels compared to the nonsymtomatizing workers with significant difference in interleukin 1\u03b2 and interleukin 6.

Inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity is an effective approach for the reduction of A\u03b2 levels. Since \u03b3-secretase targets many different substrates, selective inhibition of its cleavage of APP is believed to be critical in order to avoid undesirable side effects. \u03b3-Secretase modulator (GSM) shifts the cleavage site on APP and production of amyloidogenic to non-amyloidogenic A\u03b2 fragments.

This study was undertaken to examine the effects of SFN on behavioral changes and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). For this purpose, mice were treated with SFN (5mg/kg twice a week) for four weeks after the unilateral intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA.

These results were further supported by immunohistochemical findings in the substantia nigra that showed that SFN protected neurons from neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA.

The procedure was to reduce liver AOX activity by providing tungsten or hydralazine in the drinking water or to use the AOX-deficient DBA/2 mouse strain.

The permeation profile of PR from the formulations was assessed in in vitro permeation studies performed by using Franz diffusion cells and human epidermis as membrane. Finally, skin irritation was evaluated by the Draize test. Results: N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) resulted as the best SPE: in addition, the critical factors influencing the PR diffusion through the human epidermis when loaded in the patch resulted in the matrix thickness (X(1), p\u2009=\u20090.0957) and PR content (X(3), p\u2009=\u20090.0004) which improved the flux; conversely, NMP lacked its enhancement effect when loaded in the patch and the increase in its concentration (X(4), p\u2009=\u20090.006) affected the drug permeation through human epidermis.

Several variants of this enzyme were rationally designed based on the previously determined enzyme structure and sequence differences between the SDO and the 'conventional' GDO from Corynebacterium glutamicum. This was undertaken in order to define the structural elements that give the SDO its unique ability to dioxygenolytically cleave (substituted) salicylates.

This indicated that this enzyme variant behaves like previously known 'conventional' GDOs. Crystals of the G106A SDO variant and its complexes with salicylate and gentisate were obtained under anaerobic conditions, and the structures were solved and analyzed.

However, there is evidence in humans that addiction liability has a genetic component, and that certain personality characteristics related to temperament (e.g. the sensation-seeking trait) are associated with individual differences in addiction liability. Consequently, we have used a selective breeding strategy based on locomotor response to a novel environment to generate two lines of rats with distinct behavioral characteristics. We have found that the resulting phenotypes differ on a number of neurobehavioral dimensions relevant to addiction. Relative to bred low-responder (bLR) rats, bred high-responder (bHR) rats exhibit increased exploratory behavior, are more impulsive, more aggressive, seek stimuli associated with rewards, and show a greater tendency to relapse. We therefore utilize this unique animal model to parse the genetic, neural and environmental factors that contribute to addiction liability. Our work shows that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), dopaminergic molecules, and members of the fibroblast growth factor family are among the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that play a role in both the initial susceptibility to addiction as well as the altered neural responses that follow chronic drug exposure.

METHOD: An adult population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for warfarin, with CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype, age and target international normalized ratio (INR) as dose predictors, was bridged to children using allometric scaling methods. Its predictive properties were evaluated in an external data set of children 0-18\u00a0years old, including comparison of dose prediction accuracy with three pharmacogenetics-based algorithms for children. RESULTS: Overall, the bridged model predicted INR response well in 64 warfarin-treated Swedish children (median age 4.3\u00a0years), but with a tendency to overpredict INR in children \u22642\u00a0years old.

This review focuses on the diagnostics and treatment of viral CNS infections in the immunocompetent host from a Northern European perspective.

The slower CL was due to the reduction of hepatic biliary excretion (67.0% decrease) and hepatic CYP3A subfamily-mediated metabolism (21.9% decrease) of doxorubicin. These results might have broader implications to understand the altered pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacologic effects of doxorubicin via biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in experimental and clinical estrogen-induced cholestasis.", "anno": [[7, 8, true], [336, 337, true], [539, 540, true], [650, 651, true], [805, 806, true], [1032, 1033, true], [1152, 1153, true], [1318, 1319, true], [1555, 1556, true]]}, {"id": 23506002, "text": "A series of compounds incorporating an aromatic scaffold based on isoxazolines were prepared in the patent application (WO2012151158).

Herein, we demonstrate a design and synthesis of a new star-shaped cationic polymer containing a \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD) core and multiple oligoethylenimine (OEI) arms with folic acid (FA) linked by a bioreducible disulfide bond for efficient targeted gene delivery. The newly synthesized cationic polymer, named \u03b3-CD-OEI-SS-FA, could be cleaved efficiently, and FA was readily released under reductive condition similar to intracellular environment. The \u03b3-CD-OEI-SS-FA polymer was well-characterized and studied in terms of its gene delivery properties in FR-positive KB cells and FR-negative A549 cells under various conditions, in comparison with cationic polymers such as high molecular weight branched polyethylenimine (PEI), \u03b3-CD-OEI star-shaped cationic polymer, \u03b3-CD-OEI-FA polymer where FA was directed linked to the star polymer without disulfide linker. Our data have demonstrated that the new \u03b3-CD-OEI-SS-FA gene carrier had low cytotoxicity and possessed capacity to target and deliver DNA to specific tumor cells that overexpress FRs, as well as functions to recover and recycle FRs onto cellular membranes to facilitate continuous FR-mediated endocytosis to achieve very high levels of gene expression. This study has expanded the strategy of FA-targeted delivery by combining the smart FR-recycling function to achieve the significant enhancement of gene expression. The new FA-targeted and bioreducible carrier may be a promising efficient gene delivery system for potential cancer gene therapy.", "anno": [[272, 273, true], [537, 538, true], [721, 722, true], [1135, 1136, true], [1488, 1489, true], [1653, 1654, true], [1783, 1784, true]]}, {"id": 23122096, "text": "High resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy was proposed for the determination of the fatty acid chain profile of lipids in pork meat products during ripening.

The transesterification of total lipid extracts furnished FAME mixtures that enabled quantitation of fatty acid acyl chains in the acylglycerol and FFA portions.

In this study, we have found for the first time that Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) contributes to p53-dependent DNA damage response. Upon adriamycin (ADR) exposure, p53 as well as RUNX1 were strongly induced in p53-proficient HCT116 and U2OS cells, which were closely associated with significant transactivation of p53 target genes, such as p21(WAF)(1), BAX, NOXA, and PUMA. RUNX1 was exclusively expressed in the cell nucleus and formed a complex with p53 in response to ADR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that p53 together with RUNX1 are efficiently recruited onto p53 target gene promoters following ADR exposure, indicating that RUNX1 is involved in p53-mediated transcriptional regulation. Indeed, forced expression of RUNX1 stimulated the transcriptional activity of p53 in response to ADR. Consistent with these observations, knockdown of RUNX1 attenuated ADR-mediated induction of p53 target genes and suppressed ADR-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, RUNX1 was associated with p300 histone acetyltransferase, and ADR-dependent acetylation of p53 at Lys-373/382 was markedly inhibited in RUNX1 knockdown cells. In addition, knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of p53-p300 complex following ADR exposure. Taken together, our present results strongly suggest that RUNX1 is required for the stimulation of p53 in response to DNA damage and also provide novel insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms behind p53-dependent DNA damage response.", "anno": [[105, 106, true], [252, 253, true], [494, 495, true], [596, 597, true], [833, 834, true], [935, 936, true], [1084, 1085, true], [1256, 1257, true], [1381, 1382, true], [1627, 1628, true]]}]}
