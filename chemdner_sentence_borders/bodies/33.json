A counterrotating device equipped with a Couette geometry is used together with quantitative videomicroscopy. To evaluate the effects of differences in rheological properties of the suspending media, fluids have been selected that highlight specific constitutive features. These include a reference Newtonian fluid (N), a constant-viscosity, high-elasticity Boger fluid (BF), a wormlike micellar surfactant solution with a single dominant relaxation time (WMS), and a broad spectrum shear-thinning elastic polymer solution (ST). As expected, the trajectories are symmetric in the Newtonian fluid. In the BF, the midpoints of the spheres are observed to remain in the same plane before and after the interaction, as in the Newtonian fluid, although the path lines are in this case no longer symmetric. Interactions in the ST and WMS are highly asymmetric. Two fundamentally different kinds of path lines are observed in the WMS and ST: reversing and open trajectories. The type of trajectory depends on the initial configuration of the spheres with respect to each other and on the shear rate. On the basis of the obtained results, shear-thinning of the viscosity seems to be the key rheological parameter that determines the overall nature of the interactions, rather than the relative magnitude of the normal stress differences.", "anno": [[237, 238, true], [347, 348, true], [510, 511, true], [766, 767, true], [834, 835, true], [1038, 1039, true], [1092, 1093, true], [1205, 1206, true], [1330, 1331, true], [1567, 1568, true]]}, {"id": 23600887, "text": "Phytochemical investigation of the fresh tubers of Ophiopogon japonicus led to the isolation of two new furostanol saponins (1 and 2) together with two known steroidal saponins (3 and 4).

Because 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC), produced by 24-hydroxylase, induces apoptosis of neuronal cells, it is vital to eliminate it rapidly from cells. Here, using differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells as a model, we examined whether 24-OHC is actively eliminated via transporters induced by its accumulation. The expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 was induced by 24-OHC, as well as TO901317 and retinoic acid, which are ligands of the nuclear receptors LXR/RXR. When the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 was induced, 24-OHC efflux was stimulated in the presence of high density lipoprotein (HDL), whereas apolipoprotein A-I was not an efficient acceptor. The efflux was suppressed by the addition of siRNA against ABCA1, but not by ABCG1 siRNA. To confirm the role of each transporter, we analyzed HEK293 cells stably expressing human ABCA1 or ABCG1; we clearly observed 24-OHC efflux in the presence of HDL, whereas efflux in the presence of apolipoprotein A-I was marginal. Furthermore, the treatment of primary cerebral neurons with LXR/RXR ligands suppressed the toxicity of 24-OHC. These results suggest that ABCA1 actively eliminates 24-OHC in the presence of HDL as a lipid acceptor and protects neuronal cells. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study we examined whether the presynaptic effects of D3 receptor stimulation in the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) are modulated by Ca(2+) activation of CaMKII\u03b1. In SNr synaptosomes two procedures that increase cytoplasmic Ca(2+), ionomycin and K(+)-depolarization, blocked the additional stimulation of cAMP accumulation produced by coactivating D3 and D1 dopamine receptors.

Intercalative binding is most feasible when tricationic ligands complex with DNA, especially when it is in close connection with protein capsid.

We provide evidence that fluorescent pirenzepine derivatives, with the M1 antagonist fused to the Bodipy [558/568] fluorophore via spacers of varying lengths, exhibit orthosteric/allosteric binding properties at muscarinic M1 receptors. This behaviour was inferred from a combination of functional, radioligand and FRET binding experiments, performed under equilibrium and kinetic conditions on EGFP-fused M1 receptors. Though displaying a common orthosteric component, the fluorescent compounds inherit bitopic properties from a linker-guided positioning of their Bodipy moiety within the M1 allosteric vestibule. Depending on linker length, the fluorophore is allowed to reach neighbouring allosteric domains, overlapping or not with the classical gallamine site, but distinct from the allosteric indocarbazolole 'WIN' site. Site-directed mutagenesis, as well as molecular modeling and ligand docking studies based on recently solved muscarinic receptor structures, further support the definition of two groups of Bodipy-pirenzepine derivatives exhibiting distinct allosteric binding poses. Thus, the linker may dictate pharmacological outcomes for bitopic molecules that are hardly predictable from the properties of individual orthosteric and allosteric building blocks. Our findings also demonstrate that the fusion of a fluorophore to an orthosteric ligand is not neutral as it may confer, unless carefully controlled, unexpected properties to the resultant fluorescent tracer.

AIM OF STUDY: To investigate the effect of mitragynine after chronic morphine treatment on cyclic AMP (cAMP) level and mRNA expression of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Mitragynine was isolated from the Mitragyna speciosa plant using the acid-base extraction method. The cAMP level upon forskolin stimulation in the cells was determined using the Calbiochem(\u00ae) Direct Immunoassay Kit. The mRNA expression of the MOR was carried out using quantitative RT-PCR. RESULT: Cotreatment and pretreatment of morphine and mitragynine significantly reduced the production of cAMP level at a lower concentration of nitrogen while the higher concentration of this compound could lead to the development of tolerance and dependence as shown by the increase of the cAMP level production in foskolin stimulation. In MOR mRNA expression study, cotreatment of morphine with mitragynine significantly reduced the down-regulation of MOR mRNA expression as compared to morphine treatment only.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize the conditioned reinforcing effects of a stimulus paired with the \u03bc-opioid agonist, remifentanil, using a new-response acquisition procedure in the rat. METHODS: First, in Pavlovian conditioning (PAV) sessions, rats received response-independent IV injections of remifentanil and presentations of a light-noise compound stimulus. In paired PAV groups, injections and stimulus presentations always co-occurred. In random PAV control groups, injections and stimulus presentations occurred with no consistent relationship. Second, in instrumental acquisition (ACQ) sessions, all animals could respond in an active nose-poke that produced the stimulus alone or in an inactive nose-poke that had no scheduled consequences. RESULTS: During ACQ, rats made significantly more active nose-pokes than inactive nose-pokes after paired PAV, but not after random PAV. Between groups, rats also made more active nose-pokes after paired PAV than after random PAV. After paired PAV, increased active responding was obtained under different schedules of reinforcement, persisted across multiple ACQ sessions, and depended on the number of PAV sessions conducted.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: In this context, we performed an ethnobotanical study in a Catalan region of the eastern Pyrenees, northeast Iberian Peninsula, in order to assess the popular knowledge on useful plants. We present here the data concerning pharmaceutical uses of plants devoted to respiratory illnesses. METHODOLOGY: A total of 160 informants (94 women and 66 men, born between 1915 and 1988) were interviewed during 102 semi-structured interviews. Voucher specimens were collected, and then processed and deposited in the herbarium BCN. RESULTS: We collected information about 99 plant taxa (94 species - some of them with subspecies - of 85 genera belonging to 50 families) popularly employed to prevent or treat respiratory troubles. The degree of reliability of uses is high, as indicated for instance by an informant consensus factor of 0.83 and by high medicinal importance indexes for many taxa.

In the present work, ultra performance liquid chromatography-based metabonomics analysis was applied to investigate the urinary metabolite profiling of the renoprotective effect of FLP on adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) rat model and involved possible mechanism.

The resulting dataset was analyzed by principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis. The identification of all potential biomarkers was performed using reference standard by comparing their mass spectra, MS(E) fragments information, isotopic pattern and MassLynx i-FIT algorithm. RESULTS: By partial least squares-discriminate analysis analyses, 15 biomarkers in rat urine were identified and 11 of them were related to the pathway of adenine metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Among these biomarkers, eight biomarkers like adenine, L-acetylcarnitine, 8-hydroxyadenine, hypoxanthine, creatine, methionine, phytosphingosine and phenylalanine were reversed to the control level in FLP-treated groups and six biomarkers like 2,8-dihydroxyadenine, indole-3-carboxylic acid, 3-methyldioxyindole, ethyl-N2-acetyl-L-argininate, 3-O-methyldopa and xanthurenic acid were reversed to high normal group by FLP, which indicates that the urinary metabolic pattern significantly changed after FLP treatment.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The current study aims to evaluate the gastroprotecive mechanism(s) of methanolic (MEBT) and chloroform (CEBT) extracts of Bauhinia thonningii leaves on ethanol-induced gastric ulceration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gastric acidity, quantification and histochemistry of mucus, gross and microscopic examination, nitric oxide, lipid peroxidation, 2D gel electrophoresis, mass spectroscopy and biochemical tests were utilized to assess the mechanism(s) underlying the gastroprotective effects of MEBT and CEBT. Effect of these extracts into lipopolysaccharide/interferon-\u03b3 stimulated rodent cells were done in vitro. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies were also conducted. Antioxidant activities of MEBT and CEBT were examined using DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assays. Phytochemical analyses of MEBT and CEBT were conducted using chemical and spectroscopic methods. RESULTS: Gross and histological features confirmed the anti-ulcerogenic properties of Bauhinia thonningii. Gastroprotective mechanism of MEBT was observed to be mediated through the modulation of PAS-reactive substances, MDA and proteomics biomarkers (creatine kinase, malate dehydrogenase, ATP synthase, actin and thioredoxin). MEBT and CEBT showed no significant in vitro and in vivo effects on nitric oxide. Methanolic extract (MEBT) showed superior gastroprotective effects, polyphenolic content and antioxidant activities compared to CEBT. The plant extracts showed no in vitro or in vivo toxicity. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that MEBT possesses anti-ulcer activity, which could be attributed to the inhibition of ethanol-induced oxidative damage and the intervention in proteomic pathways but not the nitric oxide pathway.", "anno": [[30, 31, true], [163, 164, true], [181, 182, true], [370, 371, true], [393, 394, true], [686, 687, true], [792, 793, true], [851, 852, true], [939, 940, true], [1036, 1037, true], [1045, 1046, true], [1143, 1144, true], [1365, 1366, true], [1447, 1448, true], [1581, 1582, true], [1640, 1641, true], [1652, 1653, true], [1872, 1873, true]]}, {"id": 23612487, "text": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a well-known signaling sphingolipid and bioactive lipid mediator. Recently, it was reported that S1P inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. On the other hand, S1P effects on osteoblasts and bone formation are little known. In this study, we investigated the effects of S1P on osteoblasts, using two osteoblast-like cell lines, SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1. S1P activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, leading to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 and the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by \u03b2-catenin/T-cell factor complex formation in both SaOS-2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells. The inhibitors of PI3K and Akt suppressed S1P-induced nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin. We further investigated the effects of PI3K/Akt signaling on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, since \u03b2-catenin takes a central role in this signaling pathway. Both inhibitors for PI3K and Akt suppressed the nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin and T-cell factor transcriptional activity induced by Wnt-3a. S1P increased the amount of osteoprotegerin at both mRNA and protein levels, and increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, leading to the mineralization. These findings suggest that S1P activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of osteoptotegerin and osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.", "anno": [[97, 98, true], [189, 190, true], [272, 273, true], [397, 398, true], [707, 708, true], [796, 797, true], [958, 959, true], [1102, 1103, true], [1262, 1263, true], [1642, 1643, true]]}, {"id": 23612708, "text": "Members of the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) family of transcription factors regulate many cellular functions.

Most NF-\u03baB-inducing stimuli, including the viral oncoprotein Tio, lead to a concerted activation of both NF-\u03baB pathways; however, extensive crosstalk at multiple levels between these signaling cascades restricts the ability to discriminate between the canonical and the noncanonical effects. We showed that noncanonical NF-\u03baB activation by Tio depends on a distinct sequence motif that directly recruits tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). Through its TRAF3-binding motif, Tio triggered a ubiquitin-independent depletion of TRAF3 from the cytosol, which prevented TRAF3 from inhibiting signaling through the noncanonical NF-\u03baB cascade. Furthermore, the Tio-TRAF3 interaction did not affect components of the canonical NF-\u03baB signaling pathway or the expression of target genes; thus, Tio induced noncanonical NF-\u03baB independently of crosstalk with the canonical pathway.

More recent studies have identified several cell-surface and intracellular proteins that mediate myoblast fusion. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that myoblast fusion is also regulated by the activation of specific cell-signaling pathways that lead to the expression of genes whose products are essential for the fusion process and for modulating the activity of molecules that are involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement.

Unlike pristine graphene, where hydrogen adsorption favors the formation of zero-dimensional (0D) clusters, the defect cores (pentagon, heptagon and octagon) at the GBs in polycrystalline graphene promote hydrogenation along the GBs. The hydrogenation in polycrystalline graphene starts at the GBs, proceeds gradually towards the grain interior (GI) and results in smooth 1D graphane-graphene interfaces. Our calculations show that the type (ferro- or antiferro-magnetism) and strength of the magnetism can be controlled by controlling the orientation of GBs.

Seventy young male patients with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and 70 age and BMI-matched healthy males were enrolled in the present study. The patients were assigned to receive intramuscular injections of testosterone esters 250 mg every 3 weeks and transdermal testosterone applications 50 mg daily. Biochemical investigations including HDL subfractions and insulin resistance were done. Patients with CHH had higher levels of insulin, HOMA-IR, WC, triglyceride, and diastolic blood pressure. Although, the HDL cholesterol concentrations were similar in both groups, hypogonadal patients had lower HDL2 and higher HDL3 levels. The total testosterone levels were independent determinants of the HDL2 subfractions. During the follow-up, a significant increase in the BMI and WC values and a significant decrease in the levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and HDL3 were observed. No difference was present between the 2 treatment arms. These results show that patients with hypogonadism have unfavorable HDL compositions in addition to the other dysmetabolic features.
