{"head": 0, "frames": [{"id": 23620214, "text": "BACKGROUND: A new modelling approach for analysing data from discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) has been recently developed in transport economics based on the notion of regret minimization-driven choice behaviour. This so-called Random Regret Minimization (RRM) approach forms an alternative to the dominant Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach. The RRM approach is able to model semi-compensatory choice behaviour and compromise effects, while being as parsimonious and formally tractable as the RUM approach. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to introduce the RRM modelling approach to healthcare-related decisions, and to investigate its usefulness in this domain. METHODS: Using data from DCEs aimed at determining valuations of attributes of osteoporosis drug treatments and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations, we empirically compared RRM models, RUM models and Hybrid RUM-RRM models in terms of goodness of fit, parameter ratios and predicted choice probabilities. RESULTS: In terms of model fit, the RRM model did not outperform the RUM model significantly in the case of the osteoporosis DCE data (p\u00a0=\u00a00.21), whereas in the case of the HPV DCE data, the Hybrid RUM-RRM model outperformed the RUM model (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Differences in predicted choice probabilities between RUM models and (Hybrid RUM-) RRM models were small. Derived parameter ratios did not differ significantly between model types, but trade-offs between attributes implied by the two models can vary substantially. CONCLUSION: Differences in model fit between RUM, RRM and Hybrid RUM-RRM were found to be small. Although our study did not show significant differences in parameter ratios, the RRM and Hybrid RUM-RRM models did feature considerable differences in terms of the trade-offs implied by these ratios. In combination, our results suggest that RRM and Hybrid RUM-RRM modelling approach hold the potential of offering new and policy-relevant insights for health researchers and policy makers.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [213, 214, true], [351, 352, true], [516, 517, true], [528, 529, true], [671, 672, true], [680, 681, true], [979, 980, true], [988, 989, true], [1230, 1231, true], [1336, 1337, true], [1495, 1496, true], [1507, 1508, true], [1592, 1593, true], [1792, 1793, true], [1981, 1982, true]]}, {"id": 23122067, "text": "The quantity of phenols, as well as antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, were investigated in bark of Rhamnus alaternus L., R. fallax Boiss., R. intermedia Steud. et Hochst., and R. pumila Turra from natural stands in Croatia.

CdTe-QDs caused cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treated cells showed an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Altered antioxidant levels were demonstrated by depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), a decreased ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and an increased NF-E2-related Factor 2 (Nrf2) activation. Enzyme assays showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was elevated whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were depressed. Further analyses revealed that CdTe-QD exposure resulted in apoptosis, indicated by changes in levels of caspase-3 activity, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and phosphatidylserine externalization. Extrinsic apoptotic pathway markers such as Fas levels and caspase-8 activity increased as a result of CdTe-QD exposure.

Resistance of mosquitoes to organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids led to a regain of interest for the use of neonicotinoid insecticides in vector control. The present study investigated the molecular basis of neonicotinoid resistance in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. A strain susceptible to insecticides was selected at the larval stage with imidacloprid. After eight generations of selection, larvae of the selected strain (Imida-R) showed a 5.4-fold increased tolerance to imidacloprid while adult tolerance level remained low. Imida-R larvae showed significant cross-tolerance to other neonicotinoids but not to pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamates. Transcriptome profiling identified 344 and 108 genes differentially transcribed in larvae and adults of the Imida-R strain compared to the parental strain. Most of these genes encode detoxification enzymes, cuticle proteins, hexamerins as well as other proteins involved in cell metabolism. Among detoxification enzymes, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) and glucosyl/glucuronosyl transferases (UDPGTs) were over-represented. Bioassays with enzyme inhibitors and biochemical assays confirmed the contribution of P450s with an increased capacity of the Imida-R microsomes to metabolize imidacloprid in presence of NADPH. Comparison of substrate recognition sites and imidacloprid docking models of six CYP6s over-transcribed in the Imida-R strain together with Bemisia tabaci CYP6CM1vQ and Drosophila melanogaster CYP6G1, both able to metabolize imidacloprid, suggested that CYP6BB2 and CYP6N12 are good candidates for imidacloprid metabolism in Ae. aegypti.

These actions are mediated by the activation of estrogen receptors (ER) alpha (ER\u03b1) and beta (ER\u03b2), which regulate target gene transcription (genomic action) through two independent activation functions (AF)-1 and AF-2, but can also elicit rapid membrane initiated steroid signals (MISS).

METHODS: C57BL/6 diabetic mice were transplanted with syngeneic islets in the liver and simultaneously abdominally implanted with a mini-osmotic pump delivering BrdU alone or together with an immunosuppressant (tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus or mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]).

RESULTS: After 4\u00a0weeks, glycaemia was significantly higher in treated mice than in controls. Insulinaemia was significantly lower in mice treated with everolimus, tacrolimus and sirolimus.

Here, we show that the minimal copper quota of C. neoformans is maintained at a high level even when grown under conditions of stringent copper limitation. Intriguingly, when this fungal pathogen is grown in standard and copper-enriched media, it sequesters even higher levels of this essential metal, achieving levels that are far higher than non-pathogenic S. cerevisiae. The hypothesis that copper acquisition plays an essential role in virulence is further corroborated by the findings that a hypovirulent CUF1-deletant strain of C. neoformans retrieved from infected mice contains almost a 6-fold lower concentration of intracellular copper than the pathogenic wild-type strain. The concentration difference arises in part from larger-sized cuf1\u0394 cell. Under in vitro growth conditions, the size of the cuf1\u0394 cells is normal and the hypertrophy phenotype is readily induced in vitro under conditions of copper starvation.

Plasma membrane binding is the key step for AKT ubiquitination by NEDD4-1 in vivo. Ubiquitinated pAKT translocates to perinuclear regions, where it is released into the cytoplasm, imported into the nucleus, or coupled with proteasomal degradation.

Participants free of CVD/stroke and not underweight (n = 3,743) were stratified by BMI categories and metabolic risk, defined as having two or more International Diabetes Federation metabolic syndrome criteria, excluding waist circumference.RESULTSCorrelates of the MHO (n = 454 [12.1%]) included smoking, socioeconomic disadvantage, and physical inactivity. Compared with metabolically healthy normal-weight subjects (n = 1,172 [31.3%]), the MHO were more likely to develop metabolic risk (15.5 vs. 33.1%, P < 0.001) and incident diabetes (odds ratio 2.09 [95% CI 0.87-5.03]) but not CVD/stroke (1.16 [0.58-2.29]) during 5.5-10.3 years of follow-up. These risks were not seen in MHO subjects maintaining metabolic health (n = 188 [67%]). Sustained metabolic health in obese participants was associated with age \u226440 years and lower waist circumference.

Decreased aptitude in the perception, evaluation, and communication of affectively laden mental states has been associated with reduced emotion regulation, more severe drug craving in addicts, and structural/functional alterations in insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The insula and ACC represent sites of convergence between the putative neural substrates of alexithymia and those perpetuating cigarette smoking. OBJECTIVES: We examined the interrelations between alexithymia, tobacco craving, and insula/ACC neurocircuitry using resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). METHODS: Overnight-deprived smokers (n\u2009=\u200924) and nonsmokers (n\u2009=\u200920) completed six neuroimaging assessments on different days both in the absence of, and following, varenicline and/or nicotine administration. In this secondary analysis of data from a larger study, we assessed trait alexithymia and state tobacco craving using self-reports and examined the rsFC of bilateral insular subregions (anterior, middle, posterior) and dorsal ACC. RESULTS: Higher alexithymia in smokers predicted reduced rsFC strength between the right anterior insula (aI) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Higher alexithymia also predicted more severe tobacco craving during nicotine withdrawal. Critically, the identified aI-vmPFC circuit fully mediated this alexithymia-craving relation. That is, elevated alexithymia predicted decreased aI-vmPFC rsFC and, in turn, decreased aI-vmPFC rsFC predicted increased craving during withdrawal. A moderated mediation analysis indicated that this aI-vmPFC mediational effect was not observed following drug administration. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a weakened right aI-vmPFC functional circuit confers increased liability for tobacco craving during smoking abstinence.

We found that galactose and high molecular weight exopolysaccharides present in various dairy products contributed to the thermal stability of ricin. Differential scanning calorimetry also showed enhanced thermal stability for ricin at pH 4.5. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering pH and the presence of stabilizing ligands in the thermal inactivation of protein toxins in foods.", "anno": [[65, 66, true], [120, 121, true], [257, 258, true], [391, 392, true], [592, 593, true], [742, 743, true], [836, 837, true], [989, 990, true]]}, {"id": 23322166, "text": "There has been much recent interest in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling through one of its receptors, LPA1, in fibrotic diseases, but the mechanisms by which LPA-LPA1 signaling promotes pathological fibrosis remain to be fully elucidated. Using a mouse peritoneal fibrosis model, we demonstrate central roles for LPA and LPA1 in fibroblast proliferation. Genetic deletion or pharmacological antagonism of LPA1 protected mice from peritoneal fibrosis, blunting the increases in peritoneal collagen by 65.4 and 52.9%, respectively, compared to control animals and demonstrated that peritoneal fibroblast proliferation was highly LPA1 dependent. Activation of LPA1 on mesothelial cells induced these cells to express connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), driving fibroblast proliferation in a paracrine fashion. Activation of mesothelial cell LPA1 induced CTGF expression by inducing cytoskeleton reorganization in these cells, causing nuclear translocation of myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A and MRTF-B. Pharmacological inhibition of MRTF-induced transcription also diminished CTGF expression and fibrosis in the peritoneal fibrosis model, mitigating the increase in peritoneal collagen content by 57.9% compared to controls. LPA1-induced cytoskeleton reorganization therefore makes a previously unrecognized but critically important contribution to the profibrotic activities of LPA by driving MRTF-dependent CTGF expression, which, in turn, drives fibroblast proliferation.-Sakai, N., Chun, J., Duffield, J.

It is a complex disorder resulting from the interaction of several polymorphisms in different genes and environmental factors. Since we recently reported a role for low density lipoprotein-related protein (LRP)-4 in monogenic disorders with bone overgrowth, we now wanted to evaluate whether genetic variation in the LRP4 gene has an effect on the susceptibility to osteoporosis in a population based cohort from the Odense Androgen Study. We chose to genotype four common (minor allele frequency (MAF)\u22650.05) and non-synonymous coding polymorphisms located in the extracellular region of the LRP4 protein: rs3816614 (A/g), rs2306029 (G/a), rs2306033 (C/t) and rs6485702 (G/a) (large and small characters indicate major and minor alleles, respectively). Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements of the hip, the spine and whole body as well as different hip geometry parameters were available for a total of 1404 Danish men from two age groups ([20-29 years]: n=804; [60-74 years]: n=600). Using linear regression analysis adjusted for age, height and weight, we found significant associations between both rs2306029 and rs6485702 and BMD at all sites except the lumbar spine. The most significant association was found with whole body BMD (p=4.7\u00d710(-5)). In addition, we found these two polymorphisms to be associated with different geometry parameters especially of the femoral shaft. Analysis of the two associated SNPs in the separate age groups demonstrated that most associations are only present in the youngest group of Danish men. In the group of elderly men, one Bonferroni corrected association between whole body BMD and rs6485702 was found to be significant. Subsequently, all polymorphisms were included in haplotype analyses using the PLINK software (v1.07). After adjusting for age, height and weight, two out of five common haplotypes (MAF\u22650.01) were found to be of particular interest in the regulation of hip and whole body BMD (AGCG, AACA). Additional analysis suggested that these latter associations are driven by the association of rs6485702. We suggest, based on these results and the localisation of the variant in the third \u03b2-propeller domain of LRP4, that the variant has possibly a functional effect. Hereby, we conclude that common variation in the LRP4 gene determines hip and whole body BMD and thus confirm previous results from different GWAs. In addition, our data proves an additional role for LRP4 in regulating hip structure. Finally, interaction analysis for LRP4 with SOST and LRP5 showed interaction with LRP5 for femoral shaft geometry.", "anno": [[89, 90, true], [216, 217, true], [529, 530, true], [842, 843, true], [1076, 1077, true], [1263, 1264, true], [1342, 1343, true], [1473, 1474, true], [1626, 1627, true], [1758, 1759, true], [1860, 1861, true], [2047, 2048, true], [2152, 2153, true], [2315, 2316, true], [2463, 2464, true], [2549, 2550, true], [2664, 2665, true]]}, {"id": 23046389, "text": "1.\u2002Aldehyde oxidase (AO) is a cytosolic enzyme that contributes to the Phase I metabolism of xenobiotics in human and preclinical species. 2.\u2002Current studies explored in vitro metabolism of zoniporide in various animal species and humans using S9 fractions.

Screening was performed using a 12-run, 8-factor, 2-level Plackett-Burman design. This design was employed to construct polynomial equations that identified the magnitude and direction of the linear effect of homogenization pressure, number of homogenization cycles, primary and secondary emulsifiers, pre-homogenization temperature, oil loading, and ratio of vitamin E to medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) in the oil phase on particle size, polydispersity index, short-term stability, and outlet temperature of manufactured emulsions. The viscosity of vitamin E was reduced from 3700 (100%) to 64 mPa.s (30%) by MCT addition. As viscosity is critical for efficient emulsification, vitamin/MCT ratio was the most significant contributor for the stability of emulsions. Particle size increased from 236 to 388 nm, and percentage vitamin remaining emulsified after 48 h dropped from 100 to 73% with increase in vitamin/MCT ratio from 30/70 to 70/30. Significant decrease in particle size and PI, and an increase in outlet temperature were also observed with increase in homogenization pressure and number of homogenization cycles. Emulsifiers and oil loading, however, had insignificant effect on the responses. Overall, stable submicron emulsions at vitamin/MCT ratio of 30/70 could be prepared at 25,000 psi and 25 cycles in ambient conditions.
