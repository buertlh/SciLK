Objective: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the fertility and endocrine outcome in women underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy (RALM). Methods: Data from 48 RALM performed in our department between the years 2007 and 2011 have been collected. Conception rate, abortion rate, incidence of feto-maternal morbidity or severe pregnancy and labor-related complications were reported; FSH and AMH levels and ultrasound valuation of AFC has been made before and 6 months after operation. Number of cesarean sections and vaginal deliveries were described. Results: The average age of the patients was 35 years and median Body Mass Index was 23\u2009kg/m(2) (range 18-35\u2009kg/m(2)). Seven women (13%) became pregnant after RALM with eight pregnancies. One pregnancy is actually on going; there were six deliveries with caesarian section and one spontaneous delivery. No spontaneous abortions. No uterine ruptures occurred. No significant modification of ovarian function was found after myomectomy. Conclusion: RALM seems to have a favorable impact on the reproductive outcome of young patients with no impact on the ovarian function.", "anno": [[12, 13, true], [265, 266, true], [276, 277, true], [422, 423, true], [431, 432, true], [530, 531, true], [768, 769, true], [835, 836, true], [844, 845, true], [954, 955, true], [1023, 1024, true], [1138, 1139, true], [1164, 1165, true], [1194, 1195, true], [1270, 1271, true], [1282, 1283, true], [1406, 1407, true]]}, {"id": 22173956, "text": "Doash (Origanum majorana) is an herbaceous plant found commonly in Saudi Arabia.

Results obtained revealed that rats treated with doash tea and given a single dose of the heterocyclic amines, whether for 1 day (short-term) or for 1 month (long term), showed a statistically significant decrease in their excretion of indirect mutagens (IQ or PhIP). Following treatment of the rats with a single oral dose of IQ or PhIP, the highest mutagenic activity determined in the presence of an activation system was excreted in the urine after 24 h, with much lower levels of mutagencity being excreted during subsequent elimination from the body.

In light of recent evidence that PCBs cause developmental neurotoxicity via RyR-dependent mechanisms, this suggests that enantioselective PCB metabolism may influence the developmental neurotoxicity of chiral PCBs. However, enantioselective disposition of PCBs has not been fully characterized. 2. The effect of sex and cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme induction on the enantioselective metabolism of PCB 136 was studied using liver tissue slices prepared from na\u00efve control (CTL), phenobarbital (PB; CYP2B inducer) or dexamethasone (DEX; CYP3A inducer) pretreated adult Sprague-Dawley rats. PCB 136 metabolism was also examined in hippocampal slices derived from untreated rat pups. 3. In liver tissue slices, hydroxylated PCB (OH-PCB) profiles depended on sex and inducer pretreatment, and OH-PCB levels followed the rank orders male\u2009>\u2009female and PB\u2009>\u2009DEX\u2009>\u2009CTL. In contrast, the enantiomeric enrichment of PCB 136 and its metabolites was independent of sex and inducer pretreatment.

It appears that the binding of PAHs and the effectiveness of GAC to reduce sediment porewater concentrations were highly dependent on the GAC-sediment mixing ratio and hydrophobicity of the PAH. Despite the considerable fouling of GAC by organic matter and oil, 50 to 90% of the most available PAH was extracted by the GAC during a 28-d contact time, at a dose as low as 4%, which also is a feasible dose in field-scale applications aimed at cleaning the sediment by GAC addition and removal.", "anno": [[140, 141, true], [294, 295, true], [470, 471, true], [710, 711, true], [874, 875, true], [1069, 1070, true], [1367, 1368, true]]}, {"id": 23220105, "text": "Hexylsubstituted poly(lactic acid) (hexPLA) is a viscous polymer, which degrades in the presence of water similar to the structure related poly(lactic acid).

This first in vivo study toward the biocompatibility of hexPLA implants in rats over 3 months in comparison to in situ forming poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) formulations is presented here. The hexPLA implants showed only a mild acute inflammation at the injection site after application, which continuously regressed.

Confirmation of effective brain delivery of C-SLNs (p.o) was done using biodistribution studies in mice and confocal microscopy of rat brain section. There was an improvement of 90% in cognition and 52% inhibition of acetylcholinesterase versus cerebral ischemic group (I/R). Neurological scoring improved by 79%. Levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and mitochondrial complex enzyme activities were significantly increased, while lipid peroxidation, nitrite, and acetylcholinesterase levels decreased (p<0.05) after C-SLNs administration. It is noteworthy to report the restoration of SOD, GSH, catalase, and mitochondrial complex enzyme levels equivalent to sham control values. Gamma-scintigraphic studies show 16.4 and 30 times improvement in brain bioavailability (AUC) upon oral and i.v administration of C-SLNs versus solubilized curcumin (C-S).

To examine the potential side effects of Rosi treatment on bone formation, we delivered Rosi to mice using a combined model of distraction osteogenesis (DO) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DO provides a unique method to isolate the sequence of intramembranous bone formation, an important component of both fracture healing and bone homeostasis. Four groups of n=6 mice were used to compare the effects of Rosi on bone formation and cellular composition in both diabetic (Avy/a strain) and non-diabetic mice (a/a strain). New bone formation was examined by high resolution radiographs, micro-computed tomography, and histology. Precursor cells in the distraction gap were quantitated using immunohistochemical stains for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Committed osteoblasts and adipocytes in the gap were identified and quantitated by immunostaining for osteocalcin and FABP4/aP2, respectively. The diabetic model developed obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, while the control littermates remained lean, normoglycemic and insulin sensitive. Rosi treatment decreased levels of non-fasted glucose and insulin and improved insulin sensitivity in the A(vy)/a mice, but had no effect in a/a mice, indicating antidiabetic efficacy of Rosi at the tested dose.

Survivin is necessary for the appropriate separation of sister chromatids during mitosis and is involved in liver regeneration, but its role in regenerative processes is incompletely elucidated. Whether Survivin, which is classified as an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) based on domain composition, also has a role in apoptosis is controversial. The present study examined the in vivo effects of Survivin ablation in the liver and during liver regeneration after 70% hepatectomy in a hepatocyte-specific knockout mouse model. The absence of Survivin caused a reduction in the number of hepatocytes in the liver, together with an increase in cell volume, macronucleation and polyploidy, but no changes in apoptosis. During liver regeneration, mitosis of hepatocytes was associated with mislocalization of the members of the CPC, which were no longer detectable at the centromere despite an unchanged protein amount. Furthermore, the loss of survivin in regenerating hepatocytes was associated with reduced levels of phosphorylated Histone H3 at serine 28 and abolished phosphorylation of CENP-A and Hec1 at serine 55, which is a consequence of decreased Aurora B kinase activity.

Our results showed that OGD/Reox produced increase in cell volume, morphological swelling, and mitochondrial swelling. These changes were associated with the up-regulation of AQP4 in PM and the over-activation of MAPK. Silencing AQP4 expression using small interfering ribonucleic acid for AQP4 was found to block astrocytic swelling. Inhibition of the over-activation of MAPK mitigated the PM AQP4 overabundance and cellular swelling. As expected, treatment with rhEPO significantly reduced the OGD/Reox-induced increase in cell volume, morphological swelling, and mitochondrial swelling as well as the up-regulation of AQP4 in PM. In addition, cultures treated with the neutralizing anti-EPO antibody worsened the PM AQP4 abundance and cellular swelling, abolishing the protective effects mediated by rhEPO treatment. Furthermore, the over-activation of these MAPK after OGD/Reox was attenuated by rhEPO treatment significantly.
