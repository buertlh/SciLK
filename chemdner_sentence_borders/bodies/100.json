The effect of the copolymer concentration on the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) was determined under physiological conditions by cloud point (CP) and differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) methods. Then, thermosensitive microspheres were prepared from preformed copolymers by chemical cross-linking of hydroxyl groups with glutaraldehyde at a temperature situated slightly below LCST of the copolymer solution. The volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) of corresponding cross-linked microspheres was determined from swelling degree-temperature curve. The microspheres were loaded with model drug indomethacin by the solvent evaporation method. The DSC analysis proved that the drug is molecularly dispersed in the polymer network. Finally, the influence of the microsphere size on drug release was investigated. It was established that microspheres with the diameter ranging between 5 and 60\u03bcm release the drug with almost the same rate below (in the swollen state) and above the VPTT (in the collapsed state). On the contrary, microspheres with the diameter ranging between 125 and 220\u03bcm release a significantly higher amount of indomethacin below than above the VPTT.

Green tea extract strongly inhibited hemin iron absorption in both normal rats and iron-deficient rats. In normal rats administered with green tea extract, C max resulted significantly reduced, whereas in anemic rats administered with green tea extract both AUC0-t and AUC0-\u221e were reduced. On the other hand, ascorbic acid significantly affected hemin iron absorption only in iron-deficient rats, in which C max showed a significant increase.

METHODS: Men classified with the MetS underwent a sequential test meal investigation, in which blood samples were taken at regular intervals after a test breakfast (t=0 min) and lunch (t=330 min). Lipids, glucose and insulin were measured in the fasting and postprandial samples. RESULTS: MetS subjects with 3 or 4 components were subdivided into those without (n=34) and with (n=23) fasting hyperglycaemia (\u22655.6mmol/l), irrespective of the combination of components. Fasting lipids and insulin were similar in the two groups, with glucose significantly higher in the men with glucose as a MetS component (P<0.001).

Greater glucose AUC (P<0.001) and insulin maxC (P=0.010) were also observed in these individuals after the test meals. Multiple regression analysis revealed fasting glucose to be an important predictor of the postprandial TAG and glucose response.

We report here that expression of BRAF(V600E) in human neural crest progenitor cells (hNCPCs) did not induce growth arrest as seen in human melanocytes, but instead, increased their cell proliferation capacity. These cells (hNCPCs(V600E)) acquired anchorage-independent growth ability and were weakly tumorigenic in vivo. Unlike in human melanocytes, BRAF(V600E) expression in hNCPCs did not induce p16(INK4a) expression. BRAF(V600E) induced elevated expression of CDK2, CDK4, MITF and EST1/2 protein in hNCPCs, and also induced melanocytic differentiation of these cells. Furthermore, overexpression of MITF in hNCPCs(V600E) dramatically increased their tumorigenicity and resulted in fully transformed tumor cells. These findings indicate that hNCPCs are susceptible to BRAF(V600E)-induced transformation, and MITF potentiates the oncogenic effect of BRAF(V600E) in these progenitor cells.

OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigated the role of mu opioid receptors (MORs) specifically in determining hedonic responses to palatable sweet stimuli. METHODS: In Experiment 1, licking microstructure when consuming sucrose solution (2 to 20\u00a0%) was compared in MOR knockout and wildtype mice as a function of sucrose concentration and level of food deprivation. In Experiment 2, a similar examination was conducted using the palatable but calorie-free stimulus sucralose (0.001 to 1\u00a0%), allowing study of licking behavior independent of homeostatic variables. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, MOR knockout mice exhibited several alterations in sucrose licking. Although wildtype mice exhibited a twofold increase in the burst length when food deprived, relative to the nondeprived test, this aspect of sucrose licking was generally insensitive to manipulations of food deprivation for MOR knockout mice. Furthermore, during concentration testing, their rate of sucrose licking was less than half that of wildtype mice. During sucralose testing (Experiment 2), MOR knockout mice licked at approximately half the wildtype rate, providing more direct evidence that MOR knockout mice were impaired in processing stimulus palatability.

The docking of the extracellular domains of connexin hemichannels contributed by neighboring cells forms a gap junction channel that joins the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. Connexins are expressed ubiquitously in different organs, but some subtypes are expressed exclusively in certain tissues and tumors. Both gap junction channels and hemichannels participate in diverse physiological and pathological responses. However, the lack of specific reagents that inhibit only gap junction channels or hemichannels is a challenge that makes it different to discern the specific roles of either channel. Fortunately, the available information regarding the connexin sequence, secondary and tertiary structure, and their biochemical and physiological properties permits the development of strategies to block exclusively the hemichannel activity exclusively, with no effect on gap junction activity. This task is accomplished through the use of specifics antibodies that target the extracellular sites of desired connexin subtype. However, the underlying mechanism of how antibodies targeting extracellular connexin epitopes actually inhibit hemichannels remains unknown. Although these antibodies are being used for detecting and blocking of hemichannels in normal and tumor cells, they can also be potentially used for tissue-specific treatment and drug delivery in clinical applications.

Given the high heritability of MD (estimated between 31% and 42% for unipolar depression), genes coding for key regulators of the serotonergic neurotransmission have been considered as optimal candidates. The present review is focused on the role of genes coding for serotonin receptors in MD pathogenesis, since the serotonin transporter and enzymes involved in serotonin metabolism have been reviewed elsewhere. Despite the large number of candidate gene studies focusing on genes coding for serotonin receptors, results have been inconsistent.

This class of compounds was reported to improve learning and memory in several rodent and non-human primate tasks, and to normalize respiratory abnormalities in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.

The less sensitive parameter, time in the chamber containing the novel mouse versus time in the chamber containing the novel object, was not rescued by CX1837 or CX1739 treatment. Preliminary data with CX546, in which \u03b2-cyclodextrin was the vehicle, revealed behavioral effects of the acute intraperitoneal and oral administration of vehicle alone. To circumvent the artifacts introduced by the vehicle administration, we employed a novel treatment regimen using pellets of peanut butter for drug delivery. Absence of vehicle treatment effects when CX1837 and CX1739 were given in the peanut butter pellets, to multiple cohorts of BTBR and B6 control mice, confirmed that the pharmacologically-induced improvements in sociability in BTBR were not confounded by the administration procedures.

RA patients can be classified into two major groups: those who have ACPAs and those who do not. The presence of ACPAs at early stages of RA predicts the development of earlier and more widespread joint erosions, and low remission rates.Synthetic peptides can replace cognate proteins in solid-phase assays for specific autoantibody recognition in RA patients. The use of synthetic peptides instead of proteins represents an advantage in terms of the reproducibility of such immunoassays. Proteins also contain non-citrullinated epitopes that are recognized by non-RA sera and this could reduce the specificity of the test. The use of synthetic citrullinated peptides gives absolute control over the exact epitopes presented. Furthermore, it is difficult to prepare sufficient amounts of high-quality antigenic proteins with a well-defined degree of citrullination.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the mechanisms underlying the vascular effects of MPG by assessing in vitro its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and its vascular relaxing effects, and in vivo, its action on hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (PAH) in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antioxidant activity of MPG leaf hydromethanolic extract was determined by using both the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity in vitro assays. Anti-inflammatory properties were assayed on TNF\u03b1-induced VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. The vasorelaxant effect of MPG extract was studied on rat arterial rings pre-contracted with phenylephrine (1\u03bcM) in the presence or absence of the endothelium. In vivo MPG extract effects were analyzed in chronic hypoxic PAH, obtained by housing male Wistar rats, orally treated or not with MPG extract (400mg/kg/d), in a hypobaric chamber for 21 days. RESULTS: MPG leaf extract had antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It induced endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated relaxation of rat aorta and pulmonary artery. In vivo, chronic MPG treatment reduced hypoxic PAH in rat by decreasing by 22.3% the pulmonary arterial pressure and by 20.0% and 23.9% the pulmonary artery and cardiac remodelling, respectively. This effect was associated with a restoration of endothelium function and a 2.3-fold increase in endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation. MPG leaf hydromethanolic extract contained tryptophan and flavonoids, including quercetin glycosides. Both compounds also efficiently limit hypoxia-induced PAH.

DESIGN: Prospective case-based evaluation. SETTING: Academic medical center with 320 beds. SUBJECTS: Medical house staff (MDs) and ICU nurses (RNs) from one center and select critical care pharmacists (PHs). INTERVENTION: Completion of a survey containing 10 hypothetical ICU cases in which patients had agitated delirium for which a psychiatrist recommended intravenous haloperidol 5\u00a0mg every 6\u00a0hours. Each case contained different potential risk factor(s) for TdP in specific combinations. A group of five EP cardiologists agreed that haloperidol use was safe in five cases and not safe in five cases. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For each case, participants were asked to document whether they would administer haloperidol, to provide a rationale for their decision, and to state their level of confidence in that decision. Most clinicians (92 of 115 [80%]) invited to participate completed the cases. Among the five cases where EP cardiologists agreed that haloperidol was not safe, 29% of respondents felt that haloperidol was safe. Conversely, in the five cases where EP cardiologists felt haloperidol was safe, 21% of respondents believed that it was not safe. Overall respondent-EP cardiologist agreement for haloperidol use across the 10 cases was moderate (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.51).

OBJECTIVE: In the present study, the effects of systemic injection of the newly synthesized H3R antagonist ST1283 on ethanol (EtOH) voluntary intake and EtOH-conditioned reward in mice have been investigated. METHODS: Oral EtOH, saccharin, and quinine intake was assessed in a two-bottle choice paradigm using escalating concentrations of alcohol or tastant solutions. EtOH-induced place preference (CPP), EtOH-induced locomotor activity, and blood ethanol concentration (BEC) were also measured. RESULTS: Following administration of the H3R antagonist (2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.), there was a significant dose-dependent decrease in alcohol consumption and preference. Importantly, vehicle- and ST1283 (5\u00a0mg/kg)-treated mice showed similar consumption and preference to increasing concentration of both sweet and bitter tastes. More interestingly, systemic administration of ST1283 inhibited EtOH-CPP and EtOH-enhanced locomotion. This inhibition was blocked when mice were pretreated with the selective H3R agonist R-(alpha)-methyl-histamine (10\u00a0mg/kg). Finally, vehicle- and ST1283-treated mice had similar BECs. CONCLUSION: Our results show that ST1283 may decrease voluntary EtOH consumption and EtOH-CPP by altering its reinforcing effects, suggesting a novel role for histamine signaling in regulation of alcoholism.

We found that the deviation of electronic properties from a linear composition dependence is dominated by the strength of orbital interactions between D and A. Weak orbital interactions between D and A moieties tend to lead to a nonlinear composition dependence. Our results provide useful insights for band gap tuning through the adjustment of D/A compositions in D-A conjugated copolymers.", "anno": [[167, 168, true], [345, 346, true], [603, 604, true], [756, 757, true], [952, 953, true], [1112, 1113, true], [1215, 1216, true], [1344, 1345, true]]}, {"id": 23220104, "text": "We synthesized N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide polymer conjugated with zinc protoporphyrin (HPMA-ZnPP) and evaluated its application for tumor detection by imaging and treatment by light exposure using in mouse sarcoma model. To characterize HPMA-ZnPP micelle, we measured its micellar size, surface charge, stability, photochemical, biochemical properties and tissue distribution. In vivo anti-tumor effect and fluorescence imaging were carried out to validate the tumor selective accumulation and therapeutic effect by inducing singlet oxygen by light exposure. HPMA-ZnPP was highly water soluble and formed micelles spontaneously having hydrophobic clustered head group of ZnPP, in aqueous solution, with a hydrodynamic diameter of 82.8\u00b141.8 nm and zeta-potential of +1.12 mV. HPMA-ZnPP had a long plasma half-life and effectively and selectively accumulated in tumors. Although HPMA-ZnPP alone had no toxicity in S-180 tumor-bearing mice, light-irradiation significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo, similar to the cytotoxicity to HeLa cells in vitro upon endoscopic light-irradiation. HPMA-ZnPP can visualize tumors by fluorescence after i.v. injection, which suggests that this micelle may be useful for both tumor imaging and therapy. Here we describe preparation of a new fluorescence nanoprobe that is useful for simultaneous tumor imaging and treatment, and application to fluorescence endoscopy is now at visible distance.", "anno": [[226, 227, true], [382, 383, true], [564, 565, true], [780, 781, true], [873, 874, true], [1094, 1095, true], [1246, 1247, true], [1438, 1439, true]]}, {"id": 23314320, "text": "Multiple oximes have been synthesized and evaluated for use as countermeasures against chemical warfare nerve agents. The current U.S. military and civilian oxime countermeasure, 2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]-1-methylpyridin-1-ium chloride (2-PAM), is under consideration for replacement with a more effective acetylcholinesterase reactivator, 1,1'-methylenebis{4-hydroxyiminomethyl}pyridinium dimethanesulfonate (MMB-4). Kinetic data in the scientific literature for MMB-4 are limited; therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for a structurally related oxime, 1,1'-trimethylenebis{4-hydroximinomethyl}pyridinium dibromide. Based on a previous model structure for the organophosphate diisopropylfluorophosphate, the model includes key sites of acetylcholinesterase inhibition (brain and diaphragm), as well as fat, kidney, liver, rapidly perfused tissues and slowly perfused tissues. All tissue compartments are diffusion limited. Model parameters were collected from the literature, predicted using quantitative structure-property relationships or, when necessary, fit to available pharmacokinetic data from the literature. The model was parameterized using rat plasma, tissue and urine time course data from intramuscular administration, as well as human blood and urine data from intravenous and intramuscular administration; sensitivity analyses were performed. The PBPK model successfully simulates rat and human data sets and has been evaluated by predicting intravenous mouse and intramuscular human data not used in the development of the model. Monte Carlo analyses were performed to quantify human population kinetic variability in the human evaluation data set. The model identifies potential pharmacokinetic differences between rodents and humans, indicated by differences in model parameters between species. The PBPK model can be used to optimize the dosing regimen to improve oxime therapeutic efficacy in a human population.", "anno": [[116, 117, true], [415, 416, true], [655, 656, true], [915, 916, true], [962, 963, true], [1156, 1157, true], [1397, 1398, true], [1585, 1586, true], [1704, 1705, true], [1853, 1854, true], [1972, 1973, true]]}, {"id": 23343596, "text": "There is evidence that subjective responses to psychoactive drugs are related to personality traits. Here, we extend previous findings by examining personality measures in relation to acute responses to d-amphetamine (AMPH) in a large sample of healthy volunteers. Healthy adults (n=286) completed the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire Brief Form (MPQ-BF) and participated in four sessions during which they received oral AMPH (0, 5, 10, 20 mg), under double-blind conditions. Subjective responses to the drug were measured using the Profile of Mood States, Addiction Research Center Inventory, and Drug Effects Questionnaire. Drug responses were reduced via principal components analysis to three higher-order factors ('Euphoria', 'Arousal', 'Dysphoria'). Participants were rank ordered on selected MPQ-BF scales; the top and bottom third on each trait were compared on the drug response factors. High trait physical fearlessness was significantly associated with greater amphetamine-related Arousal, and high trait reward sensitivity was significantly associated with greater Euphoria. In addition, high trait impulsivity was significantly associated with greater Arousal and Euphoria. These results provide further evidence that individual differences in the subjective effects of AMPH are partially explained by differences in personality, and are consistent with the idea that both personality and responses to stimulants depend upon shared neurochemical systems.", "anno": [[99, 100, true], [263, 264, true], [484, 485, true], [634, 635, true], [764, 765, true], [905, 906, true], [1095, 1096, true], [1195, 1196, true], [1476, 1477, true]]}]}
