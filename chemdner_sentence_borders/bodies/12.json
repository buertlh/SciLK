AhR is widely known for regulating the transcription of drug metabolizing enzymes involved in the xenobiotic metabolism of carcinogens and therapeutic agents, such as cytochrome P450-1B1 (CYP1B1). Additionally, AhR has also been reported to interact with multiple signaling pathways during prostate development. Here we investigate the effect of sustained AhR signaling on androgen receptor function in prostate cancer cells. Immunoblot analysis shows that AhR expression is increased in androgen independent (C4-2) prostate cancer cells when compared to androgen sensitive (LNCaP) cells. RT-PCR studies revealed constitutive AhR signaling in C4-2 cells without the ligand induced activation required in LNCaP cells. A reduction of AhR activity by short RNA mediated silencing in C4-2 cells reduced expression of both AhR and androgen responsive genes. The decrease in androgen responsive genes correlates to a decrease in phosphorylated androgen receptor and androgen receptor expression in the nucleus. Furthermore, the forced decrease in AhR expression resulted in a 50% decline in the growth rate of C4-2 cells. These data indicates that AhR is required to maintain hormone independent signaling and growth by the androgen receptor in C4-2 cells.

Because of transcription from two distinct promoters, the p63 gene encodes two isoforms, TAp63 and \u0394Np63. Although TAp63 acts as a tumor suppressor, \u0394Np63 functions as an oncogene and is often overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting \u0394Np63 might be used to manage tumors that overexpress \u0394Np63. Here we found that arsenic trioxide, a frontline agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, inhibits \u0394Np63 but not TAp63 expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, we found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of \u0394Np63 protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway but has little effect on the level of \u0394Np63 transcript. Furthermore, we found that arsenic trioxide activates the Pirh2 promoter and consequently induces Pirh2 expression. Consistent with this, we found that knockdown of Pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 enhances, arsenic-induced degradation of \u0394Np63 protein. Importantly, we found that knockdown of \u0394Np63 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of \u0394Np63 inhibits, growth suppression induced by arsenic. Together, these data suggest that arsenic degrades \u0394Np63 protein at least in part via Pirh2-dependent proteolysis and that inhibition of \u0394Np63 expression facilitates tumor cells to arsenic-induced death.", "anno": [[106, 107, true], [212, 213, true], [342, 343, true], [438, 439, true], [604, 605, true], [780, 781, true], [896, 897, true], [1053, 1054, true], [1196, 1197, true], [1400, 1401, true]]}, {"id": 23273150, "text": "The natural and fundamental proclivities of interaction between a pair of peptide units are examined using high-level ab initio calculations.

Changes in liver composition, molecular level changes and enzyme activities of selected detoxification-mediated and antioxidant defence markers were measured. Changes in total lipid, lipid peroxide and protein carbonyl concentrations in emerald rock cod liver were consistent with increases in nucleus surface area in the PBDE-treated groups, suggesting alterations in cellular function. Changes in the activities of selected antioxidant enzymes indirectly indicated oxidative stress, possibly resulting in the changes in liver composition.

Thus, identification of these metabolites in the heart may help to explain the controversy regarding the cardiovascular effects of testosterone. We analyzed the expression patterns of these testosterone-metabolizing enzymes and assessed the effect of its enzymatic activity inhibition on ischemia (40 min)/reperfusion (4h, I/R) via the left anterior descendent coronary artery in intact and gonadectomized male rats. Myocardial damage was measured as percentage of infarcted area vs. area at risk. Aromatase and 5\u03b1-reductase protein expression was found in the left ventricle of intact and orchidectomized rats. Exogenous testosterone had no effect on I/R induced myocardial damage in intact male rats, meanwhile exogenous testosterone protects against I/R injury in orchidectomized rats. However, enzymatic inhibition of aromatase increased myocardial damage in the presence of testosterone, while enzymatic inhibition of 5\u03b1-reductase significantly decreased the level of myocardial damage. Our results also showed that sub-chronic inhibition of 5\u03b1-reductase resulted in myocardial protection in both groups. Furthermore, in orchidectomized and intact male rats IV treatment with DHT induces a significant increase in the myocardial damage induced by I/R.

The kinetic profiles of MDZ oxidation and the substrate inhibition in mouse intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions were very similar to those in human microsomes but were different from those in rat microsomes.

A major sensing principle utilized by state-of-the-art cantilever sensors is based on analyte-induced surface stress changes, which result in static bending of a cantilever. The sensor performance, however, suffers from the intrinsically small change in surface stress induced by analytes, especially for molecular recognition such as antigen-antibody binding. Through the contact angle change on a tailored solid surface, it is possible to convert a tiny surface stress into a capillary force-a much larger physical quantity needed for a practical sensor application. In this work, a micro-cantilever sensor based on contact angle analysis (CAMCS) was proposed to effectively enhance the sensitivity of a sensor in proportion to the square of the length to thickness ratio of the cantilever structure. CAMCS chips were fabricated using a standard complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process to demonstrate a 1250-fold enhancement in the sensitivity of surface stress to bioanalyte adsorption using a piezoresistive sensing method.

Biochemical analysis showed significant decrease in serum total protein and phospholipids levels, while serum total lipid was significantly elevated post Al treatment. In addition, significant decrease in total protein, phospholipids and cholesterol levels in the testes of Al-treated rats was recorded.

To test this hypothesis, rats were subjected to a 7-day study and were administered the suspected metabolite and two low-potency mPGES-1 inhibitor analogs, where amide hydrolysis was undetectable in rat hepatocyte experiments. The results suggested that compounds with a reduced propensity to undergo amide hydrolysis, thus having less ability to form M1, reduced the risk of inducing kidney toxicity. Rats treated with M1 alone showed no histopathologic change in the kidney, which was likely related to underexposure to M1.

The growth of this interdrop frost front is shown to be up to 3 times slower on the superhydrophobic surface compared to a control hydrophobic surface, due to the jumping-drop effect dynamically minimizing the average drop size and surface coverage of the condensate. A simple scaling model is developed to relate the success and speed of interdrop ice bridging to the drop size distribution.
