Considering apoptosis-related factors, the polysaccharides suppressed AKT activity through the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation at Thr(308) and/or Ser(473). The growth of HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells was suppressed by the up-regulation of a subunit of PI3K and phospho-PTEN, which are modulators of AKT activity. The polysaccharides also activated the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway by stimulating the activation of Bcl-2 family proteins to release cytochrome c and Smac and cleave caspase-9 and caspase-3 in HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells.

A low molecular weight polyethyleneimine modified with deoxycholic acid (PEI1.8-DA)-based delivery strategy was suggested for the cardiac application of SHP-1 siRNA to overcome the poor gene delivery efficiency to myocardium due to the highly charged structures of the compact cardiac muscles. The PEI1.8-DA conjugates formed stable nanocomplexes with SHP-1 siRNA via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes effectively silenced SHP-1 gene expression in cardiomyocytes, leading to a significant inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis under hypoxia. In comparison to conventional gene carriers, relatively large amounts of siRNA molecules remained after treatment with the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes. Cardiac administration of the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes resulted in substantial improvement in SHP-1 gene silencing, which can be explained by the enhancement of cardiac delivery efficiency of the PEI1.8-DA conjugates. In addition, in vivo treatment with the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes induced a highly significant reduction in myocardial apoptosis and infarct size in rat MI models.

Characterization studies of the prepared liposomal formulations were performed by dynamic light scattering, extrusion, and (1)H and (31)P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Ketoprofen transport studies across human skin were performed for all formulations. RESULTS: Stable ketoprofen loaded formulations were prepared. Addition of an edge activator, in the absence of the drug, increased the elasticity of the vesicles and liposomes. Ketoprofen loading reduced the elasticity of the liposomes and surfactant-based-vesicles. However, at saturation the elasticity was still higher than that in the absence of the edge activator and ketoprofen, except for ketoprofen loaded liposomes with Span 80. NMR studies revealed that the ketoprofen molecules were entrapped in a vesicle bilayer in all vesicular formulations, and that the ketoprofen molecules affected the phosphate mobility in the liposomal formulations.

Recent evidence showing nuclear import and a direct transcriptional role for both InsR and IGF1R adds a new layer of complexity to this dialog. Hence, in addition to the classical roles associated with cell-surface receptors (eg, ligand binding, autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain, activation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and additional substrates, protein-protein interactions with membrane and cytoplasm components), new data are consistent with nuclear (genomic) role(s) for both InsR and IGF1R. The present review provides a brief overview of the physical and functional similarities and differences between InsR and IGF1R and describes data from a number of laboratories providing evidence for a new layer of signaling regulation (ie, the ability of InsR and IGF1R to translocate to the cell nucleus and to elicit genomic activities usually associated with transcription factors). The ability of InsR and IGF1R to function as transcription factors, although poorly understood, constitutes a new paradigm in signal transduction.

To determine whether these enhancers are also necessary for the maintenance of transcriptional activity, we conditionally deleted E3' in mature B cells that possessed Ed(-/-) alleles. Upon E3' deletion, the locus became rapidly silenced and lost positive histone epigenetic marks, and the mature B cells partially dedifferentiated, induced RAG-1 and -2 along with certain other pro-B cell makers, and then redifferentiated after triggering Ig\u03bb gene rearrangements. We conclude that the Ig\u03ba gene's downstream enhancers are essential for both the establishment and maintenance of transcriptional activity and that there is no cellular memory of previous transcriptional activity in this locus.

However, these promoter SNPs have complex effects on G6PC2 fusion gene expression, and our data suggested that only rs13431652 is a potentially causative SNP. Here we examine the effect of rs560887 on G6PC2 pre-mRNA splicing and the contribution of an additional common G6PC2 promoter SNP, rs2232316, to the association signal. METHODS: Minigene analyses were used to characterise the effect of rs560887 on G6PC2 pre-mRNA splicing. Fusion gene and gel retardation analyses characterised the effect of rs2232316 on G6PC2 promoter activity and transcription factor binding. The genetic association of rs2232316 with FPG variation was assessed using regression adjusted for age, sex and BMI in 4,220 Europeans with normal FPG. RESULTS: The rs560887-G allele was shown to enhance G6PC2 pre-mRNA splicing, whereas the rs2232316-A allele enhanced G6PC2 transcription by promoting Foxa2 binding.

Using cholesterol depletion, pharmacological inhibitors, RNA interference, and dominant-negative mutants, we define the mechanisms involved in perinuclear accumulation of PKC\u03b1 and identify the non-proteasomal mechanism mediating its degradation. We show that intracellular accumulation of PKC\u03b1 involves at least two clathrin-independent, cholesterol/lipid raft-mediated pathways that do not require ubiquitination of the protein; one is dynamin-dependent and likely involves caveolae, whereas the other is dynamin- and small GTPase-independent.

The rate constant (kobs) of formation of decamethylferrocenium ion (Fc*(+)) in the catalytic four-electron reduction of O2 by Fc* in the presence of a large excess CF3COOH and O2 obeyed first-order kinetics. The kobs value was proportional to the concentration of catalyst 1 or 2, whereas the kobs value remained constant irrespective of the concentration of CF3COOH or O2. This indicates that electron transfer from Fc* to 1 or 2 is the rate-determining step in the catalytic cycle of the four-electron reduction of O2 by Fc* in the presence of CF3COOH. The second-order catalytic rate constant (kcat) for 1 is 4 times larger than the corresponding value determined for 2.

We administered four escalating single doses of oral midazolam (0.0001-3\u2009mg) to 12 healthy participants, stratified according to CYP3A5 carrier status, to assess pharmacokinetics linearity. We then evaluated the interactions with the CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole (400\u2009mg q.d.) after nanogram and regular doses of midazolam. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) were linear over the entire range of doses. Ketoconazole reduced midazolam oral clearance by 92.8%. AUC and Cmax increased by 1,540 and 363%, respectively. CYP3A5 carrier status had no influence on midazolam oral clearance or its inhibition by ketoconazole.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of the most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram on sleep rebound following REMS deprivation and, in parallel, on the activation of MCH-containing neurons. METHODS: Escitalopram or vehicle (10\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered to REMS-deprived (72\u00a0h) or home cage male Wistar rats. During the 3-h-long \"rebound sleep\", electroencephalography was recorded, followed by an MCH/Fos double immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: During REMS rebound, the time spent in REMS and the number of MCH/Fos double-labeled neurons in the lateral hypothalamus increased markedly, and REMS latency showed a significant decrease. All these effects of REMS deprivation were significantly attenuated by escitalopram treatment. Besides the REMS-suppressing effects, escitalopram caused an increase in amount of and decrease in latency of slow wave sleep during the rebound. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that despite the high REMS pressure caused by REMS deprivation procedure, escitalopram has the ability to suppress REMS rebound, as well as to diminish the activation of MCH-containing neurons, in parallel.

In addition, the cumulative nociceptive response time for intraplantar formalin injection (2nd phase), intrathecal injection of substance P (0.7\u00a0\u03bcg) or glutamate (20\u00a0\u03bcg) was diminished by oleanolic acid. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) pretreatment with naloxone (opioid receptor antagonist) or methysergide (5-HT serotonergic receptor antagonist) attenuated antinociceptive effect induced by oleanolic acid in the writhing test. However, yohimbine (adrenergic receptor antagonist) did not affect antinociception induced by oleanolic acid. The results indicate that oleanolic acid shows an antinociceptive property in various pain models such as writhing, formalin, substance P and glutamate pain tests. Furthermore, this antinociceptive effect of oleanolic acid may be mediated by opioidergic and serotonergic receptors, but not adrenergic receptors.", "anno": [[71, 72, true], [240, 241, true], [352, 353, true], [556, 557, true], [773, 774, true], [883, 884, true], [1047, 1048, true], [1195, 1196, true]]}, {"id": 23516024, "text": "Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a purely motor mononeuritis multiplex characterized by the presence of conduction block on motor but not on sensory nerves and by the presence of high titers of anti-GM1 antibodies. Several data point to a pathogenetic role of the immune system in this neuropathy, although this has not yet been proved. Several uncontrolled studies and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of therapy with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in MMN. However, this therapy has a short-lasting effect that needs to be maintained with periodic infusions. This can be partly overcome by the use of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) at the same dose. The high cost and need for repeated infusions have led to the search for other immune therapies, the efficacy of which have not yet been confirmed in randomized trials. In addition, some therapies, including corticosteroids and plasma exchange, are not only ineffective but have been associated with clinical worsening. More recently, a number of novel therapies have been investigated in MMN, including interferon-\u03b21a, the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab and the complement inhibitor eculizumab. Preliminary data from open-label uncontrolled studies show that some patients improve after these therapies; however, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy. Until then, IVIg (and SCIg) remains the mainstay of treatment in MMN, and the use of other immune therapies should only be considered for patients not responding to, or becoming resistant to, IVIg.", "anno": [[217, 218, true], [339, 340, true], [500, 501, true], [602, 603, true], [697, 698, true], [866, 867, true], [1017, 1018, true], [1202, 1203, true], [1381, 1382, true], [1579, 1580, true]]}, {"id": 23517008, "text": "We report a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of protein adsorption on the surface of nanosized carbon allotropes, namely single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) considering both the convex outer surface and the concave inner surface, together with a graphene sheet for comparison. These systems are chosen to investigate the effect of the surface curvature on protein adsorption at the same surface chemistry, given by sp(2) carbon atoms in all cases. The simulations show that proteins do favorably interact with these hydrophobic surfaces, as previously found on graphite which has the same chemical nature. However, the main finding of the present study is that the adsorption strength does depend on the surface topography: in particular, it is slightly weaker on the outer convex surfaces of SWNT and is conversely enhanced on the inner concave SWNT surface, being therefore intermediate for flat graphene. We additionally find that oligopeptides may enter the cavity of common SWNT, provided their size is small enough and the tube diameter is large enough for both entropic and energetic reasons. Therefore, we suggest that proteins can effectively be used to solubilize in water single-walled (and by analogy also multiwalled) carbon nanotubes through adsorption on the outer surface, as indeed experimentally found, and to functionalize them after insertion of oligopeptides within the cavity of nanotubes of appropriate size.", "anno": [[285, 286, true], [456, 457, true], [614, 615, true], [916, 917, true], [1108, 1109, true], [1440, 1441, true]]}, {"id": 23517010, "text": "We experimentally demonstrate that plasmonic nanoparticles embedded in the evanescent field of subwavelength optical waveguides (WGs) are highly sensitive to distances normal to the propagation of light, showing an \u223c10\u00d7 increase in spatial resolution compared to the optical field decay of the WG. The scattering cross-section of the Au nanoparticle is increased by the plasmon-dielectric coupling interaction when the nanoparticle is placed near the dielectric surface of the WG, and the decay of the scattering signal is enhanced, showing angstrom level distance sensitivity within 10 nm from the WG. Numerical studies with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method correlate well with the experimental results. To demonstrate real-time monitoring of a single molecule stretching in the evanescent field, we linked individual single-stranded DNA molecules between the WG and plasmonic nanoparticles and pushed on the nanoparticles with fluidic forces.

Consequently, three new compounds, named thailanstatins A (1), B (2), and C (3), were isolated from the fermentation broth of B. thailandensis MSMB43. Thailanstatins are proposed to be biosynthesized by a hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase pathway. They differ from 4 by lacking an unstable hydroxyl group and by having an extra carboxyl moiety; those differences endow thailanstatins with a significantly greater stability than 4 as tested in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. In vitro assays showed that thailanstatins inhibit pre-mRNA splicing as potently as 4, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in the single to sub-\u03bcM range. Cell culture assays indicated that thailanstatins also possess potent antiproliferative activities in representative human cancer cell lines, with half-maximal growth inhibitory concentrations in the single nM range.
