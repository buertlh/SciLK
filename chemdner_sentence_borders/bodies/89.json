The incorporation of biocide moieties, such as quaternary ammonium salts (QAS), can impart additional antibiofouling properties to PDMS-based FR coating systems. In this study, the molecular surface structures of two different types of QAS-incorporated PDMS systems were investigated in different chemical environments using sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG). Specifically, a series of PDMS coatings containing either a QAS with a single ammonium salt group per molecule or a quaternary ammonium-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (Q-POSS) were measured with SFG in air, water, and artificial seawater (ASW) to investigate the relationships between the interfacial surface structures of these materials and their antifouling properties. Although previous studies have shown that the above-mentioned materials are promising contact-active antifouling coatings, slight variations of the QAS structure can lead to substantial differences in the antifouling performance. Indeed, the SFG results presented here indicated that the surface structures of these materials depend on several factors, such as the extent of quaternization, the molecular weight of the PDMS component, and the functional groups of the QAS used for incorporation into the PDMS matrix. It was concluded that in aqueous environments a lower extent of Q-POSS quaternization and the use of ethoxy (instead of methoxy) functional groups for QAS incorporation facilitated the extension of the alkyl chains away from the nitrogen atom of the QAS on the surface. The SFG results correlated well with the antifouling activity studies that indicated that the coatings exhibiting a lower concentration of longer alkyl chains protruding out of the surface can neutralize microorganisms more effectively, ultimately leading to better antifouling performance. Furthermore, the results of this study provide additional evidence that incorporated QAS exert their antimicrobial activity through a two-step interaction. The first step is the adsorption of the bacteria on the surface as a result of the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged microorganisms and the positively charged QAS nitrogen atoms on the surface. The second step is the disruption of the cell membranes by the penetration of the QAS long, extended alkyl chains.", "anno": [[148, 149, true], [310, 311, true], [530, 531, true], [924, 925, true], [1154, 1155, true], [1441, 1442, true], [1711, 1712, true], [2002, 2003, true], [2158, 2159, true], [2374, 2375, true], [2489, 2490, true]]}, {"id": 23608222, "text": "Glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic \u00df-cells depends critically on activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channel).

In the present study, we compared insulin secretion by voluntary feeding (self-motivated, oral nutrient ingestion) and by forced feeding (intra-gastric nutrient injection via gavage) in wild-type (Kir6.2+/+) and Kir6.2-/- mice. Under ad libitum feeding or during voluntary feeding of standard chow, blood glucose levels and plasma insulin levels were similar in Kir6.2+/+ and Kir6.2-/- mice. By voluntary feeding of carbohydrate alone, insulin secretion was induced significantly in Kir6.2-/- mice, but was markedly attenuated compared to that in Kir6.2+/+ mice. On forced feeding of standard chow or carbohydrate alone, the insulin secretory response was markedly impaired or completely absent in Kir6.2-/- mice. Pre-treatment of a muscarine receptor antagonist, atropine methyl nitrate, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, almost completely blocked insulin secretion induced by voluntary feeding of standard chow or carbohydrate in Kir6.2-/- mice.

Changes in visceral adipose tissue tended to be related to changes in HOMA2-IR (r = 0.35; P = 0.07). Changes in HbA1c were related to changes in mid-thigh muscle attenuation (r = 0.52; P = 0.001).

The latter mechanisms is pertinent to fibrinogen adsorption at lower pH where the entire molecule is positively charged. Extensive calculations enabled one to determine the jamming surface concentration (coverage) of molecules adsorbed under the side-on and end-on orientations as well as the total coverage.

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide formation, might be linked to future deterioration in glucose tolerance in stable coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We studied 80 non-diabetic men (mean age 55 +/- 11 years) with stable angina who underwent successful elective complex coronary angioplasty and were receiving a standard medical according to practice guidelines. Plasma ADMA and its structural isomer symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) were measured prior to coronary angiography. An estimate of insulin resistance by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR index) was calculated from fasting insulin and glucose. Deterioration in glucose tolerance was defined as development of type 2 diabetes or progression from a normal glucose tolerance to impaired fasting glucose. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 55 months 11 subjects developed type 2 diabetes and 13 progressed to impaired fasting glucose. Incident deterioration of glucose tolerance was associated with ADMA (hazard ratio [HR] per 1-SD increment 1.64 [95% CI: 1.14--2.35]; P = 0.007), log (HOMA-IR index) (HR = 1.60 [1.16--2.20]; P = 0.004) and body-mass index (HR = 1.44 [0.95--2.17]; P = 0.08) by univariate Cox regression. ADMA (HR = 1.65 [1.14--2.38]; p = 0.008) and log (HOMA-IR index) (HR = 1.55 [1.10--2.17]; P = 0.01) were multivariate predictors of a decline in glucose tolerance. ADMA and SDMA were unrelated to body-mass index, HOMA-IR index, insulin or glucose. CONCLUSIONS: ADMA predicts future deterioration of glucose tolerance independently of baseline insulin resistance in men with stable CAD. Whether this association reflects a contribution of endothelial dysfunction to accelerated decline of insulin sensitivity, or represents only an epiphenomenon accompanying pre-diabetes, remains to be elucidated.

RESULTS: We found that drug abstinence after repeated amphetamine stimulation decreased locomotor activity and exploratory behavior in the open field test, increased immobility in the forced swim test, and had no significant effect on the recognition index in the novel object recognition test.

Many possible applications for luminescent, amorphous coordination compounds, such as organic light-emitting diodes, sensors, and organic lasers, rely on photophysical properties like quantum efficiency to be repeatable.

Lurasidone is a new atypical antipsychotic agent with very high affinity for the 5-HT7 receptor. Patients in clinical trials have reported improved scores in depression ratings.

In the repeated open-space swim test lurasidone was able to reverse the despair induced by repeated swims in a manner similar to the commonly used antidepressant citalopram.

At least one prevalent mutation (I1061T) has been shown to cause a folding defect, which results in failure of endosomal localization, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. Here, we show that several oxysterols and their derivatives act as pharmacological chaperones; binding of these compounds to I1061T NPC1 corrects the localization/maturation defect of the mutant protein. Further, these compounds alleviate intracellular cholesterol accumulation in patient-derived fibroblasts, suggesting that they may have therapeutic potential.

In this context, it has been postulated that the uptake of toxic substances formed during meat and fish processing such as heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs) may be causally related to colon carcinogenesis. In a previous study, we have shown that 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), the most abundantly formed HCA in the above-mentioned food items, is mainly absorbed in the small intestine (i.e. proximal jejunum) of the rat. In the present study, we analysed whether PhIP can actively be secreted by enterocytes in the rat proximal jejunum and distal colon. Unidirectional PhIP flux rates from the mucosal-to-the serosal compartment (J ms ) and in the opposite direction (J sm ) were examined in Ussing chambers with (14)C-PhIP as radiotracer and in the absence of electrochemical gradients. Under these experimental conditions, significant negative net flux rates (J net \u00a0=\u00a0J ms \u00a0-\u00a0J sm ) can only be explained by an active secretion of PhIP into the luminal compartment, and such an effect was observed in the rat distal colon, but not in the proximal jejunum. Moreover, the data obtained suggest that the breast cancer resistance protein, the multidrug resistance protein 4 and P-glycoprotein are not involved in the active secretion of PhIP in the rat distal colon.

The intracellular portion of the receptor is intrinsically active in solution, and to study its regulation, we measured autophosphorylation as a function of EGFR surface density in cells. Without EGF, intact EGFR escapes inhibition only at high surface densities. Although the transmembrane helix and the intracellular module together suffice for constitutive activity even at low densities, the intracellular module is inactivated when tethered on its own to the plasma membrane, and fluorescence cross-correlation shows that it fails to dimerize. NMR and functional data indicate that activation requires an N-terminal interaction between the transmembrane helices, which promotes an antiparallel interaction between juxtamembrane segments and release of inhibition by the membrane. We conclude that EGF binding removes steric constraints in the extracellular module, promoting activation through N-terminal association of the transmembrane helices.", "anno": [[84, 85, true], [272, 273, true], [348, 349, true], [633, 634, true], [869, 870, true], [1036, 1037, true]]}, {"id": 23403272, "text": "Pulmonary endothelial cells have been demonstrated to have a critical role in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced lung injury. Our preliminary experiments indicated that Paeoniflorin protected human EA.hy926 endothelial cells from radiation-induced oxidative injury. This study was designed to confirm the protective effect of Paeoniflorin against radiation-induced endothelial cellular damage and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Preincubation of EA.hy926 cells with Paeoniflorin before \u03b3-radiation resulted in significant inhibition of apoptosis, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced cell viability. In particular, we showed that Paeoniflorin significantly reduced the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and enhanced production of the endogenous antioxidants, glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in EA.hy926 cells. Treatment of these cells with Paeoniflorin significantly induced HO-1 expression. Moreover, Paeoniflorin promoted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor-2 (Nrf-2). The Paeoniflorin-induced HO-1 expression was abrogated by Nrf2 siRNA. Furthermore, inhibition of HO-1 with zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZNPP) significantly reversed the protective effect of Paeoniflorin against radiation-induced damage in EA.hy926 cells.

Plasma TNF-\u03b1, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) were determined at the end of this treatment. Renal damage was identified by histologic observation and the higher of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Also, changes of PPAR-\u03b4 in kidney and renal mesangial cell (RMC) were analyzed using Western blot. Plasma TNF-\u03b1 was markedly raised in mice showing hepatic steatosis. However, the levels of blood lipids (TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C) and TNF-\u03b1 were not modified by the treatment of etanercept although the hepatic steatosis has been improved. Etanercept shows renal protection from histological identification and recovery of serum BUN and creatinine levels. Moreover, restoration of PPAR-\u03b4 expression by etanercept was observed in mice kidney. Direct effect of TNF-\u03b1 on PPAR-\u03b4 expression was also characterized in RMC cell. We suggest that renal damage in mice with hepatic steatosis is mainly induced by increase of TNF-\u03b1 through the decrease of renal PPAR-\u03b4.
