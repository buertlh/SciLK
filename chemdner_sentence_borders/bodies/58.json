Methods Subjects were selected from the Asklepios study (n=2524), a population-representative random sample between 35 and 55 yrs, free from overt cardiovascular disease at baseline. Analyses were restricted to 2078 subjects (1013 women and 1065 men), not using antihypertensive or thyroid medication nor having anti-TPO levels above clinical cut-off or TSH levels outside the reference range. All subjects were phenotyped in-depth and underwent comprehensive echocardiography, including diastolic evaluation. Thyroid function parameters were determined by automated electrochemiluminescence. Results Heart rate was robustly positively associated with (quartiles of) (F)T3, both in subjects with TSH levels within reference (0.27-4.2 \u00b5U/l) as in narrow TSH-range (0.5-2.5 \u00b5U/l) (p\u22640.0001).

Conclusion We have demonstrated a strong positive association between thyroid hormone levels within the euthyroid range and heart rate, and more subtle effects on cardiac function and structure.

Cynomolgus FMO1, FMO2, FMO3, and FMO5 metabolized benzydamine, and FMO1/FMO3 and FMO3 also metabolized methimazole and trimethylamine, respectively. Rates of benzydamine N-oxygenation (catalyzed by FMO3) varied (approximately 20-fold) among the 28 cynomolgus livers and were significantly correlated with FMO3 protein expression, indicating that the inter-animal variations in benzydamine N-oxygenation might be partly accounted for by the variable FMO3 expression. Cynomolgus FMO6 metabolized benzydamine only slightly, but minimal expression of FMO6 in all tissue precludes the importance of FMO6 in drug metabolism, unlike cynomolgus FMO1, FMO2, FMO3, and FMO5 which were all functional.

Both pathways contribute towards potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, the overall functional role of EPAC2A in \u00df-cells as it relates to in vivo glucose homeostasis remains incompletely understood. Therefore, we have examined in vivo GSIS in global EPAC2A knockout mice. Additionally, we have conducted in vitro studies of GSIS and calcium dynamics in isolated EPAC2A-deficient islets. EPAC2A deficiency does not impact glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mice under basal conditions. However, when mice are exposed to diet-induced insulin resistance, pharmacologic secretagogue stimulation of \u00df-cells with an incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue or with a Fatty Acid Receptor 1/GPR40 selective activator, EPAC2A is required for the increased \u00df-cell response to secretory demand. Under these circumstances, EPAC2A is required for potentiating the early dynamic increase in islet calcium levels after glucose stimulation, which is reflected in potentiated first phase insulin secretion.

Different types of lateral interactions among membrane components can take place, giving rise to multiple levels of lateral order that lead to highly organized structures. Early observations suggested that some of the lipid components of biological membranes may play active roles in the creation of these levels of order. In the late 1980s, a diverse series of experimental findings collectively gave rise to the lipid raft hypothesis. Lipid rafts were originally defined as membrane domains, i.e., ordered structures created as a consequence of the lateral segregation of sphingolipids and differing from the surrounding membrane in their molecular composition and properties. This definition was subsequently modified to introduce the notion that lipid rafts correspond to membrane areas stabilized by the presence of cholesterol within a liquid-ordered phase. During the past two decades, the concept of lipid rafts has become extremely popular among cell biologists, and these structures have been suggested to be involved in a great variety of cellular functions and biological events. During the same period, however, some groups presented experimental evidence that appeared to contradict the basic tenets that underlie the lipid raft concept.

LSP1-2111, the group III mGlu receptor orthosteric agonist, with a high affinity towards mGlu4 receptors, was previously shown to exhibit antipsychotic-like action in animal models displaying positive symptoms of schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: Here, we decided to investigate the possible role of LSP1-2111 in models of negative (social interaction) and cognitive (NOR) symptoms of psychosis. We also investigated the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in the LSP1-2111-induced antipsychotic effects. Apart from the above-mentioned models of negative and cognitive symptoms, MK-801 and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity tests, plus the DOI-induced head twitches in mice as models for positive symptoms of psychosis, were used in this part of the investigations. RESULTS: LSP1-2111 (0.5, 2, and 5\u00a0mg/ kg) dose-dependently inhibited MK-801-induced deficits in social interaction and NOR tests. The effects of the drug were antagonized by 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY100635 (0.1\u00a0mg/kg). A similar inhibition of LSP1-2111-induced effects was observed in models of positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

Recently, clinical findings of renal failure and kidney stones in infants have been associated with ingestion of melamine-contaminated infant formula. To understand the toxicity and clinical outcome of melamine exposure, repeated oral dose studies in rats and monkeys were performed to characterize the subchronic toxicity of melamine. Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical signs, body weights, ophthalmic findings, clinical pathology, gross pathology, organ weights, and microscopic observations. The first rat study was intended to be a 14-day oral study followed by an 8-day recovery period. The dose levels were 140, 700, and 1,400\u00a0mg/kg/day (lowered to 1,000\u00a0mg/kg/day subsequently due to mortality). Oral administration of melamine at 700\u00a0mg/kg/day for 14 consecutive days in rats produced compound-related clinical signs (red urine), decreased body weights, and changes in clinical pathology (increased serum urea nitrogen and creatinine) and anatomical pathology (renal tubular cell debris, crystal deposition, and hyperactive regeneration of renal tubular epithelium). The kidney was identified as the target organ. Oral administration at 1,400\u00a0mg/kg/day (subsequently lowered to 1,000\u00a0mg/kg/day) resulted in animal death and moribundity. There were no treatment-related findings in the 140\u00a0mg/kg/day group. There were no compound-related findings in the high-dose recovery animals. The second rat study was a 5-day oral toxicity study with genomic biomarkers assayed in the kidney tissues. At the top dose of 1,050\u00a0mg/kg/day, similar clinical and anatomical pathology findings as described above were observed. The genes measured, Kim-1, Clu, Spp1, A2m, Lcn2, Tcfrsf12a, Gpnmb, and CD44, were significantly up-regulated (fivefold to 550-fold), while Tff3 was significantly down-regulated (fivefold). These results indicated that genomic markers could sensitively diagnose melamine-induced kidney injury. A 3-month oral study with 4-week recovery in monkeys was also conducted.

Further examination reveals that the respiratory distress and atelectasis occur in the homozygous mutants. The maturation of lung and alveolar epithelium is delayed in the mutant, as indicated by narrowed air spaces, thickened interstitial septa, and increased glycogen content in the lungs of Stk40(-/-) mice. The reduction in levels of T1-\u03b1, SP-B, and SP-C indicates delayed maturation of both type I and type II respiratory epithelial cells in Stk40(-/-) lungs. Moreover, Stk40 is found to be most highly expressed in lungs of both fetal and adult mice among all organs tested. Mechanistically, a genome-wide RNA microarray analysis reveals significantly altered expression of multiple genes known to participate in lung development. The expression of some genes involved in lipid metabolism, immune response, and glycogen metabolism is also disrupted in the lung of Stk40(-/-) mice. Protein affinity purification identifies RCN2, an activator of ERK/MAPK signaling, as an STK40-associated protein. Consistently, Stk40 deficiency attenuates the ERK/MAPK activation, and inhibition of ERK/MAPK activities reduces surfactant protein gene expression in lung epithelial cells.

Up to 53\u00a0% of ingested Pb was rapidly eliminated from the exposed rats via faeces within 24\u00a0h after exposure. Faecal excretion in exposed rats differed significantly when compared to that of the control group. Fasting before exposure reduced Pb excretion by up to 50\u00a0%. Faecal excretions of both examined Pb forms exhibited almost identical patterns. Considerable differences were revealed concerning total excretion levels; lead acetate was excreted in amount greater extent than those of phytobound Pb. Results of our study suggest that Pb forms occurring in the P. stratiotes tissues are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract to a greater extent than Pb from lead acetate. Therefore, higher portions of ingested Pb can be available for potential accumulation in tissues of exposed subjects.", "anno": [[90, 91, true], [366, 367, true], [465, 466, true], [545, 546, true], [602, 603, true], [769, 770, true], [879, 880, true], [979, 980, true], [1039, 1040, true], [1120, 1121, true], [1274, 1275, true], [1451, 1452, true], [1569, 1570, true]]}, {"id": 23323519, "text": "We study the self-assembly of ordered nanostructures, that is, nanorings (NRs) and quantum dots (QDs), epitaxially grown on a polygonal cross-section nanowire (PCS-NW) using both theoretical and phase-field modeling.

Squalene did not affect the CAs and MN frequency, in all treatments in vitro. A significant increase in SCEs was observed in almost all concentrations at 24h treatment. Squalene did not affect significantly the comet tail length (CTL) (except 2500\u03bcg/ml) and comet tail intensity (CTI) at all treatments in vitro.

The effects of IL-13 are mediated via a pathway that is initiated by binding to a heterodimeric receptor consisting of IL-13R\u03b11 and IL-4R\u03b1. Antibodies raised against IL-13 can block its inflammatory effects by interfering with binding to either of the two receptor polypeptides. Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal anti-IL-13 antibody that has shown clinical benefit in a phase II study for the treatment of moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma. Here we report the molecular structure of IL-13 in complex with the Fab from lebrikizumab by X-ray crystallography at 1.9\u00c5 resolution. We show that lebrikizumab inhibits IL-13 signaling by binding to IL-13 with very high affinity and blocking IL-13 binding to IL-4R\u03b1. In addition, we use site-directed mutations to identify the most important antibody contributors to binding.

A promising in vitro assay is the cardiac embryonic stem cell test (ESTc), in which the effect of developmental toxicants on cardiomyocyte differentiation is assessed. Recently, we developed a neural differentiation variant of the stem cell test (neural embryonic stem cell test [ESTn]). In both of these models, we have previously performed a series of transcriptomic studies to characterize gene expression changes (1) across time during normal differentiation and (2) in response to a series of developmental toxicants in the ESTn and ESTc. Here, using the cumulative of these studies, we compared gene expression profiles of ESTn and ESTc over time as well as model-specific changes induced by seven compounds, comprising six known in vivo developmental toxicants and one negative control. Time-related gene expression profiles showed similarities between the two EST systems. However, specific genes could be identified changing over time differently in each model related to the two different lineages of differentiation. Interestingly, compound-induced gene expression changes were generally model specific, especially for methylmercury and flusilazole, which were predicted better in ESTn and ESTc, respectively. Valproic acid-induced gene expression changes were most comparable out of the six developmental toxicants between the ESTn and ESTc. Direct transcriptomic comparisons between the ESTn and ESTc indicate that combined transcriptomic analyses support and complement each other.
