To date, however, optimal dosing has not been established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the minimal allopurinol doses necessary to achieve adequate 6-TGN concentrations in combination with low-dose azathioprine. METHODS: A stepwise dose-escalation of allopurinol was performed in 11 azathioprine-pretreated IBD patients with inadequately low 6-TGN concentrations (<235\u00a0pmol/8\u2009\u00d7\u200910(8) erythrocytes) and/or elevated MMPN concentrations (>5,000\u00a0pmol/8\u2009\u00d7\u200910(8) erythrocytes) and/or elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase levels one- to threefold the upper limit of normal). Six patients were recruited into an open study, and five were treated in the context of an individualized therapeutic approach. Adverse effects, azathioprine metabolites, liver enzymes and whole blood counts were monitored two to three times per month. RESULTS: Adequate 6-TGN concentrations were achieved with a combination of 25\u00a0mg allopurinol and 50\u00a0mg azathioprine in one patient and with 50\u00a0mg allopurinol and 50\u00a0mg azathioprine in nine patients.

Steady-state, time-resolved fluorescence and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) studies provide evidence for the formation of both 1:1 and 2:1 (CB7\u22c5CPT) stoichiometries. Astonishingly, we have found that protonation of CPT takes place at a higher concentration of macrocycle (\u226550 \u03bcM) when the 2:1 stoichiometric complex develops. However, we did not find any proof for protonation of CPT when it is encased by a \u03b2-cyclodextrin cavity, which has a cavity size almost the same as that of CB7. Hence, we conclude that electron-rich carbonyl portals of CB7 have an important role in protonation of the drug in the 2:1 inclusion complex. Docking and semi-empirical quantum chemical calculations have been employed to gain an insight into the molecular picture of orientation of CPT in the inclusion complexes. It is clearly seen from the optimised structure of the 2:1 (CB7\u22c5CPT) inclusion complex that the quinoline nitrogen of CPT does not reside within either of the CB7 cavities, rather it is almost sandwiched between two CB7 rings, and therefore, it experiences huge electron density exerted by both carbonyl portals of the macrocycles.

RESULTS: Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that overexpression of miR-32 promoted SW480 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, reduced apoptosis, and resulted in downregulation of PTEN at a posttranscriptional level. However, miR-32 knock-down inhibited these processes in HCT-116 cells and enhanced the expression of PTEN protein.

Therefore, glutamate receptors, in particular metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, have become important targets for medication development for the treatment of drug dependence. In this review article, we focus on the mGlu7 receptor subtype, and discuss recent findings with AMN082, a selective mGlu7 receptor allosteric agonist, in animal models with relevance to drug dependence. Systemic or local administration of AMN082 into the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical brain region involved in reward and drug dependence processes, inhibited the reinforcing and motivational effects of cocaine, heroin and ethanol, as assessed by the intravenous drug self-administration procedure. In addition, AMN082 inhibited the reward-enhancing effects induced by cocaine, as assessed in the intracranial self-stimulation procedure, and cocaine- or cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. In\u00a0vivo microdialysis studies indicated that systemic or intra-NAc administration of AMN082 significantly decreased extracellular \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and elevated extracellular glutamate, but had no effect on extracellular dopamine in the NAc, suggesting that a non-dopaminergic mechanism underlies the effects of AMN082 on the actions of cocaine. Further, data indicated that AMN082-induced changes in glutamate were the net effect of two actions: one is the direct inhibition of glutamate release by activation of mGlu7 receptors on glutamatergic neurons; another is the indirect increases of glutamate release mediated by decreases in GABA transmission. These increases in extracellular glutamate functionally antagonized cocaine-induced inhibition of NAc-ventral pallidum GABAergic neurotransmission, and therefore, the rewarding effects of cocaine. In addition, elevated extracellular glutamate activated presynaptic mGlu2/3 autoreceptors which in turn inhibited cocaine priming- or cue-induced enhancement of glutamate release and reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Taken together, these findings suggest that the mGlu7 receptor is an important target for medication development for the treatment of drug dependence.

In this study, we examine the role of TGF-\u03b21-induced L1CAM expression and macrophages in malignant transformation of intestinal epithelial cells. We demonstrate that TGF-\u03b21 stimulation leads to a Slug-dependent upregulation of L1CAM expression already in the colonic intestinal epithelial cell line NCM460 thereby enhancing cell motility and apoptosis resistance. Accordingly, NCM460 cells acquired a migratory and apoptosis-resistant phenotype if transfected with L1CAM. Immunohistochemistry of colonic biopsies revealed considerable L1CAM expression in intestinal epithelial cells in tissues from IBD patients but not in normal colonic tissues. Moreover, L1CAM expression increased with duration of disease being associated with the presence of CD33+ macrophages. Coculture with macrophages generated from monocyte colony-stimulating factor (MCSF)-treated monocytes led to the upregulation of Slug and L1CAM in NCM460 cells thereby elevating cell motility and apoptosis resistance. Pharmacological inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 signalling abolished expression of Slug and L1CAM in cocultured NCM460 cells resulting in decreased cell migration and apoptosis resistance.

Its pathogenesis is complex, and involves a state of 'lipotoxicity' in which insulin resistance, with increased free fatty acid release from adipose tissue to the liver, play a key role in the onset of a 'lipotoxic liver disease' and its progression to NASH. The diagnosis of NASH is challenging, as most affected patients are symptom free and the role of routine screening is not clearly established. A complete medical history is important to rule out other causes of fatty liver disease (alcohol abuse, medications, other). Plasma aminotransferase levels and liver ultrasound are helpful in the diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH, but a liver biopsy is often required for a definitive diagnosis.

Thyroid hormone directly affects serum creatinine in muscle and low thyroid function might exert a similar direct effect in the kidney. The goal of the study was to evaluate this possibility by assessment of the inulin-based GFR and to examine the mechanism underlying the reduction of GFR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Renal and glomerular hemodynamics were assessed by simultaneous measurements of plasma clearance of para-aminohippurate (CPAH) and inulin (Cin) in 26 patients with serum creatinine <1.00 mg/dl and without thyroid disease. All subjects were normotensive with or without antihypertensive treatment and were kept in a sodium-replete state. Renal and glomerular hemodynamics were calculated using Gomez`s formulae. RESULTS: Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), including within the normal range (0.69-4.30 \u03bcIU/ml), was positively correlated with vascular resistance at the afferent arteriole (Ra) (r = 0.609, p = 0.0010), but not at the efferent arteriole (Re).

Multiple anterior, posterior, medial and lateral blocks (2 mm \u00d7 2 mm) were prepared from the proximal femoral shaft and SR micro-CT imaged at the Advanced Photon Source.

In silico analysis using an Ns H-NOX subunit of guanylate cyclase revealed a pocket on the macromolecule surface where 1-nitro-2-phenylethane preferentially docked. In vitro, 1-nitro-2-phenylethane increased cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) levels in rat aortic rings, an effect also reversed by ODQ. In conclusion, 1-nitro-2-phenylethane produces vasodilator effects by stimulating the soluble guanylate cyclase-cGMP pathway.", "anno": [[88, 89, true], [233, 234, true], [350, 351, true], [568, 569, true], [826, 827, true], [961, 962, true], [1130, 1131, true], [1298, 1299, true], [1463, 1464, true], [1610, 1611, true], [1736, 1737, true]]}, {"id": 23571773, "text": "With increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), there is an opportunity to use the free-text portion of EHRs for pharmacovigilance. We present novel methods that annotate the unstructured clinical notes and transform them into a deidentified patient-feature matrix encoded using medical terminologies. We demonstrate the use of the resulting high-throughput data for detecting drug-adverse event associations and adverse events associated with drug-drug interactions. We show that these methods flag adverse events early (in most cases before an official alert), allow filtering of spurious signals by adjusting for potential confounding, and compile prevalence information. We argue that analyzing large volumes of free-text clinical notes enables drug safety surveillance using a yet untapped data source. Such data mining can be used for hypothesis generation and for rapid analysis of suspected adverse event risk.Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2013); advance online publication 10 April 2013. doi:10.1038/clpt.2013.47.", "anno": [[144, 145, true], [314, 315, true], [480, 481, true], [687, 688, true], [820, 821, true], [931, 932, true], [1043, 1044, true]]}, {"id": 22963374, "text": "The analysis of the polar fraction of Galeopsis angustifolia Ehrh. ex Hoffm. indicates that the main components are iridoids and flavonoids.

Transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of cellular oxidative stress. This study examined the role of Nrf2 in CSA-mediated antioxidant effects on human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cell line. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon H2O2 and CSA treatment was lower than that of H2O2 alone. CSA activated Nrf2 as evaluated by Western blotting. A luciferase reporter assay also demonstrated that CSA-activated signaling resulted in the increased transcriptional activity of Nrf2 through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) enhancer sequence. Our study indicated that treatment of HepG2 cells with CSA induces Nrf2-dependent ARE activity and gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunits by activation of PI3K/AKT, ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Inhibition of Nrf2 by siRNA reduced CSA-induced upregulation of these Nrf2-related enzymes. These results suggest that the Nrf2/ARE pathway plays an important role in the regulation of CSA-mediated antioxidant effects in HepG2 cells.", "anno": [[134, 135, true], [262, 263, true], [379, 380, true], [490, 491, true], [543, 544, true], [754, 755, true], [1045, 1046, true], [1137, 1138, true], [1279, 1280, true]]}]}
