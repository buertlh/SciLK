It is known that the mechanical environment is important in fracture healing. Furthermore, PTH and mechanical loading has been suggested to have synergistic effects on intact bone. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the effect of PTH(1-34) on fracture healing in rats was influenced by reduced mechanical loading. For this purpose we used female, 25-week-old ovariectomized rats. Animals were subjected to closed midshaft fracture of the right tibia ten weeks after ovariectomy. Five days before fracture, half of the animals received Botulinum Toxin A-injections in the muscles of the fractured leg to induce muscle paralysis (unloaded group), while the other half received saline injections (control group). For the following eight weeks, half of the animals in each group received injections of hPTH(1-34) (20\u2009\u00b5g/kg/day) and the other half received vehicle treatment. Fracture healing was assessed by radiology, DXA, histology and bone strength analysis. We found that unloading reduced callus area significantly, while no effects of PTH(1-34) on callus area were seen in neither normally nor unloaded animals. PTH(1-34) increased callus bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) significantly, while unloading decreased callus BMD and BMC significantly. PTH(1-34)-treatment increased bone volume of the callus in both unloaded and control animals. PTH(1-34)-treatment increased ultimate force of the fracture by 63% in both control and unloaded animals and no interaction of the two interventions could be detected. PTH(1-34) was able to stimulate bone formation in normally loaded as well as unloaded intact bone. In conclusion, the study confirms the stimulatory effect of PTH(1-34) on fracture healing and our data suggest that PTH(1-34) is able to promote fracture healing, as well as intact bone formation during conditions of reduced mechanical loading.", "anno": [[105, 106, true], [183, 184, true], [286, 287, true], [440, 441, true], [506, 507, true], [605, 606, true], [836, 837, true], [997, 998, true], [1084, 1085, true], [1240, 1241, true], [1400, 1401, true], [1494, 1495, true], [1662, 1663, true], [1761, 1762, true], [2006, 2007, true]]}, {"id": 23585358, "text": "Soluble covalent organic nanoframeworks up to generation 2.5 (G2.5) are synthesized with self-similar H-shaped conformations by using a bottom-up approach including iterative C-H bond functionalization.

For release control, the use of high-molecular-weight PLGA (HMW 270 000) restrains the initial burst release of protein compared to that of low-MW PLGA (LMW 40 000). Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly of chitosan and alginate on MCs is also useful in controlling the release profile of biomolecules. LBL (7-layer) treatment is effective in suppressing the initial burst release of protein compared to no LBL (0-layer). The difference of cumulative albumin release between HMW (7-layer LBL) and LMW (0-layer LBL) PLGA is determined to be more than 40% on day 5. When dual angiogenic growth factors (GFs), such as platelet-derived GF (PDGF) and vascular endothelial GF (VEGF), are encapsulated separately in the core and shell domains, respectively, the VEGF release rate is much greater than that of PDGF, and the difference of the cumulative release percentage between the two GFs is about 30% on day 7 with LMW core PLGA and more than 45% with HMW core PLGA. As for the angiogenic potential of MC GFs with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the fluorescence signal of CD31+ suggests that the angiogenic sprout of ECs is more active in MC-mediated GF delivery than conventional GF delivery, and this difference is significant, based on the number of capillary branches in the unit area.

In a previous paper (Part I), we examined the possibility that fluctuations in potential energy E and particle mobility \u03bc associated with this 'dynamic heterogeneity' might offer information about the scale of collective motion in glassy materials based on molecular dynamics simulations of the glassy interfacial region of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) at elevated temperatures. We found that the noise exponent associated with fluctuations in the Debye-Waller factor, a mobility related quantity, was directly proportional to the scale of collective motion L under a broad range of conditions, but the noise exponent associated with E(t) fluctuations was seemingly unrelated to L. In the present work, we focus on this unanticipated difference between potential energy and mobility fluctuations by examining these quantities at an atomic scale. We find that the string atoms exhibit a jump-like motion between two well-separated bands of energy states and the rate at which these jumps occur seems to be consistent with the phenomenology of the 'slow-beta' relaxation process of glass-forming liquids. Concurrently with these local E(t) jumps, we also find 'quake-like' particle displacements having a power-law distribution in magnitude so that particle displacement fluctuations within the strings are strikingly different from local E(t) fluctuations. An analysis of these E(t) fluctuations suggests that we are dealing with 'discrete breather' excitations in which large energy fluctuations develop in arrays of non-linear oscillators by virtue of large anharmonicity in the interparticle interactions and discreteness effects associated with particle packing.

Ligand protonation in aqueous solution has been analyzed by means of potentiometric, (1)H NMR, UV-vis, and fluorescence emission measurements. The molecule binds up to four protons in the pH range 2-11. Protonation takes place on the aliphatic tetraamine chain, while the acridine nitrogen does not participate to proton binding even at very low pH. Differently from acridine, the UV-vis spectra are almost unaffected by the pH. On the opposite, the emission spectra are strongly pH-dependent. In fact, at low pH values, the spectra show a blue-shifted emission, resembling that of unprotonated acridine, while at slightly acidic and alkaline pH the fluorescence features a red-shifted band similar to that of acridinium cation. This unusual behavior occurs in the mono-, bi-, and triprotonated forms of the compound and is interpreted as due to an excited state proton transfer from an aliphatic ammonium group adjacent to the acridine moiety to the acridine nitrogen. In the fully protonated state, this process is prevented owing to unfavorable molecular arrangements mainly determined by electrostatic repulsions.

In this process, a fraction of the fragments (the least crystalline fragments) dissolves at elevated temperature, but the dissolved polymer crystallizes onto the ends of the remaining seed fragments upon cooling. This process yields longer nanostructures (up to 1 \u03bcm) with uniform width (ca. 15 nm) and a narrow length distribution.

For PI1000-PFS50 (the subscripts refer to the number average degree of polymerization) in decane, these factors include the presence of a good solvent (THF) for PFS and the effect of annealing the fragments prior to the self-seeding experiments. THF promoted the dissolution of the micelle fragments, while preannealing improved their stability.

The most remarkable result of these experiments is our finding that the corona-forming chain plays an important role in affecting how the PFS chains crystallize in the core of the micelles and, subsequently, the range of temperatures over which the micelle fragments dissolve.

In this work, possible reaction mechanisms for the degradation of OH-initiated atmospheric oxidation of VA are investigated. The potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the reaction of OH radical with VA in the presence of O2 and NO have been studied using the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) method. The initial addition reactions of more and less substituted ethylenic C-atoms of VA are treated separately, followed by a conventional transition state theory (TST) calculation for reaction rates. The direct H-abstraction mechanism and kinetics have also been studied. The initial OH addition occurs through a prereactive complex, and the calculated rate constants in the temperature range 250-350 K for both the addition reactions are found to have negative temperature dependence. The calculation indicates that the reaction proceeds predominantly via the addition of OH radical to the double bond rather than the direct abstraction of H-atoms in VA.

Two types of structures have been considered: a carbene structure where an intact CH2 fragment is bound to the metal (M+-CH2) and a carbyne (hydrido-methylidyne) structure with both a CH and a hydrogen bound to the metal separately (H-M+-CH).

RESULTS: Artemisia copa had a relaxant effect in endothelium-intact aortic rings that had been pre-contracted with 10(-7)M phenylephrine (Emax=96.7\u00b11.3%, EC50=1.1mg/ml), 10(-5)M 5-hydroxytriptamine (Emax=96.7\u00b13.5%, EC50=1.5mg/ml) and 80mM KCl (Emax=97.9\u00b1 4.4%, EC50=1.6mg/ml).

This pre-treatment also induced a significant attenuation of the norepinephrine-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner (Emax: 72.7% of inhibition for 3mg/ml and 27% de inhibition for 1mg/ml) in a Ca(2+) free medium.

In addition, the chemical characterization of the volatiles obtained by microdistillation technique from the balsam and the sub-extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. RESULTS: Pharmacological experiments have clearly demonstrated that 150 and 300mg/kg doses of Styrax liquidus given orally to rats showed significant gastric protection. On GC-MS analysis of the resin, overall, 31 compounds representing 99.8% of the total oil were identified where styrene (81.9%), cinnamyl alcohol (6.9%) and \u03b1-pinene (3.5%) were identified as the major components.

This study reports on a novel strategy to enhance gemcitabine treatment impact on urothelial cells by combining a pharmacologically advantageous prodrug approach with the pharmacokinetic benefits of a glycan-targeted carrier system. The conversion of gemcitabine to its 4-(N)-stearoyl derivative (GEM-C18) allowed for stable, homogeneous incorporation into PLGA microparticles (MP) without compromising intracellular drug activation. Fluorescence-labeled GEM-C18-PLGA-MP were surface-functionalized with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) or human serum albumin (HSA) to assess in direct comparison the impact of biorecognitive interaction on binding rate and anchoring stability. MP adhesion on urothelial cells of non-malignant origin (SV-HUC-1), and low- (5637) or high-grade (HT-1376) carcinoma was correlated to the resultant antiproliferative and antimetabolic effect in BrdU and XTT assays. More extensive and durable binding of the WGA-GEM-C18-PLGA-MP induced a change in the pharmacological profile and substantially higher cytotoxicity, allowing for maximum response within the temporal restrictions of instillative administration (120min).

Only individuals aged 40-84 years for whom information was available on the SEP indicators, education and income were included (N = 76,038). Two different aspects of poor adherence were applied as outcome measures: (1) Proportion of days covered (PDC) with medication below 80 %, assuming a daily dose of one tablet (continuity); (2) Discontinuation defined as a gap between two consecutive prescriptions exceeding 365 days (persistence). Stratum-specific logistic regression analyses were applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for PDC <80 % across SEP, adjusting for age and hypertension. Hazard ratio (HR) for discontinuation was estimated by Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Adjusting mutually for income and education, the OR for PDC <80 % decreased with increasing income. Comparing the highest income quintile with the lowest, the OR were 0.64 (95 % Confidence Interval 0.64-0.65) and 0.73 (0.73-0.74) in men aged 40-64 and 65-84 years, respectively; in women, the figures were 0.79 (0.79-0.79) and 0.95 (0.94-0.95), respectively.

Here, we report a novel mechanism of Nrf2 activation by arsenic that is distinct from that of chemopreventive compounds. Arsenic deregulates the autophagic pathway through blockage of autophagic flux, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes and sequestration of p62, Keap1, and LC3. Thus, arsenic activates Nrf2 through a non-canonical mechanism (p62-dependent), leading to a chronic, sustained activation of Nrf2. In contrast, activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane and tert-butylhydroquinone depend upon Keap1-C151 and not p62 (the canonical mechanism). More importantly, SF and tBHQ do not have any effect on autophagy. In fact, SF and tBHQ alleviate arsenic-mediated deregulation of autophagy.

Hypervalent molecules are formed when it is energetically favorable for the electrons in a lone pair orbital to be recoupled, allowing each of the electrons to form chemical bonds with ligands.

To test this hypothesis, we utilized two chemically distinct types of Nrf2-activator. One is the thiol-reactive agent oltipraz (OPZ), a typical Nrf2-activator, and the other is a novel biaryl urea compound, termed NK-252. NK-252 exhibits a greater Nrf2-activating potential than OPZ.

The term \"Gateway Hypothesis\" describes this developmental sequence of drug involvement. In prior work, we have developed a mouse model to study the underlying metaplastic behavioral, cellular and molecular mechanisms by which exposure to one drug, namely nicotine, affects the response to another drug, namely cocaine. We found that nicotine enhances significantly the changes in synaptic plasticity in the striatum induced by cocaine (Levine et\u00a0al., 2011). Here we ask: does the metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine also apply in the amygdala, a brain region that is involved in the orchestration of emotions and in drug addiction? We find that pretreatment with nicotine enhances long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in response to cocaine in the amygdala. Both short-term (1 day) and long-term (7 days) pre-exposure to nicotine facilitate the induction of LTP by cocaine. The effect of nicotine on LTP is unidirectional; exposure to nicotine following treatment with cocaine is ineffective. This metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine is long lasting but reversible. The facilitation of LTP can be obtained for 24 but not 40 days after cessation of nicotine. As is the case in the striatum, pretreatment with Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, simulates the priming effect of nicotine. These results provide further evidence that the priming effect of nicotine may be achieved, at least partially, by the inhibition of histone acetylation and indicate that the amygdala appears to be an important brain structure for the processing of the metaplastic effect of nicotine on cocaine.

During monocytes differentiation to macrophages, CXCR7 was up-regulated at mRNA and protein levels, with more expression in M1 than in M2 phenotype. In addition, CXCR7 induction was associated with a SDF-1 signaling switch from the pro-survival ERK and AKT pathways in monocytes to the pro-inflammatory JNK and p38 pathways in macrophages. The latter effect was mimicked by a CXCR7-selective agonist TC14012 and abolished by siRNA knockdown of CXCR7.

Results: The results of DSC revealed that HSPC and DPPC can combine into one phase. The findings of molecular modeling study suggested that HSPC interacts with DPPC via electrostatic interaction.

Compounds 2 and 3 were reported for the first time as natural product derivatives.", "anno": [[391, 392, true], [490, 491, true], [682, 683, true], [752, 753, true], [835, 836, true]]}, {"id": 23600800, "text": "ATP-gated P2X3 receptors of sensory ganglion neurons are important transducers of painful stimuli and are modulated by extracellular algogenic substances, via changes in the receptor phosphorylation state. The present study investigated the role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase CASK in interacting and controlling P2X3 receptor expression and function in mouse trigeminal ganglia. Most ganglion neurons in situ or in culture co-expressed P2X3 and CASK. CASK was immunoprecipitated with P2X3 receptors from trigeminal ganglia and from P2X3/CASK-cotransfected HEK cells. Recombinant P2X3/CASK expression in HEK cells increased serine phosphorylation of P2X3 receptors, typically associated with receptor upregulation. CASK deletion mutants also enhanced P2X3 subunit expression. After silencing CASK, cell surface P2X3 receptor expression was decreased, which is consistent with depressed P2X3 currents. The reduction of P2X3 expression levels was reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132. Moreover, neuronal CASK/P2X3 interaction was upregulated by NGF signaling and downregulated by P2X3 agonist-induced desensitization. These data suggest a novel interaction between CASK and P2X3 receptors with positive outcome for receptor stability and function. As CASK-mediated control of P2X3 receptors was dependent on the receptor activation state, CASK represents an intracellular gateway to regulate purinergic nociceptive signaling.
