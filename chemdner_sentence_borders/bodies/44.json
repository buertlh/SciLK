Contractions were produced by electrical field stimulation of perivascular nerves (EFS), norepinephrine (NE), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), high K(+) solution and by calcium chloride (CaCl(2) ) in Ca(2+) -free and high K(+) , Ca(2+) -free solution. The EFS-evoked contractions were more sensitive to resveratrol and to NS1619-selective openers of big calcium-sensitive (BK(Ca) ) channels, than NE-evoked contractions. Effects of resveratrol on the ATP-evoked contractions were weak. Blockers of BK(Ca) channels partly inhibited the effect of resveratrol only in EFS-contracted preparations. Western blotting showed that RPV expressed K(Ca) 1.1 protein. Inhibitors of ATP- and voltage-sensitive K(+) channels did not modify the effects of resveratrol. None of the antagonists of K(+) channels affected the resveratrol inhibition of NE-evoked contractions and effect of high concentrations of resveratrol on the EFS-evoked contractions. Resveratrol more potently inhibited CaCl(2) than potassium chloride contractions of RPV. Thus, BK(Ca) channels partly mediate the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on the neurogenic contractions of RPV. The smooth muscle Ca(2+) channels and/or Ca(2+) mobilizing through cells might be involved in the effects of resveratrol on the contractility of RPV.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify new bone formation after implantation of bone graft material obtained after reaming of the tibia in a bilateral critical-sized iliac wing defect in sheep and to investigate the effect of the augmentation of this graft. A reamer bone graft alone, or after short term incubation in a dexamethasone enriched solution, and a reamer graft collected using beta-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) granules in the filter of the RIA collection device were compared to autologous iliac wing graft.

Three months after implantation, the amount of new bone formation (as percentage of the total defect volume) in the defects was evaluated ex-vivo by means of micro-CT and histomorphometry. The mean amount of bone in the autologous iliac wing graft group was 17.7% and 16.8% for micro-CT and histomorphometry, respectively.

Here, we show that the anti-apoptotic activity of [6]-shogaol in astrocytes following exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) involves a marked up-regulation of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

Moreover, [6]-shogaol counteracted the reduced expression of ERK1/2 in H(2) O(2) -treated astrocytes and protected these cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis by attenuating the impairment of mitochondrial function proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Additionally, [6]-shogaol inhibits the expression of the apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3 in H(2) O(2) -treated astrocytes.

Progression in the field has taken a recent step forward with the approval of ruxolitinib (Jakafi), a selective inhibitor of JAK1/2 and very recently tofacitinib (Xeljanz), a pan-JAK inhibitor. There are many new JAK family enzyme inhibitors in the clinic now with a range of selectivity profiles. More selective JAK2 or JAK3 compounds are now coming through in considerable numbers and this review attempts to provide an update of the recent patent literature of those new compounds. An overview is given on the diversity of core structures employed for inhibitor design showing that the vast majority of compounds are based on classic ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor heterocycles. AREAS COVERED: This review updates new patents claiming JAK2 and/or JAK3 inhibitors published from 2010 to 2012. Pre-2010 patents have been extensively covered in previous reviews. Comments on the context of each chemical series are given where applicable to orientate the readers on the bewildering array of molecular designs now available. This review does not cover JAK1 or TYK2 inhibitors but mention is made of these where they occur within series of JAK2/3 inhibitors. Given the overlap between many pharmacophores, it was not possible to completely separate inhibitors of JAK2 from JAK3, hence the material is organized by JAK2, JAK3 and JAK2/3 and within each section by alphabetical order of the patent assignee, some companies having published five or more patents, such as Ambit (10), Incyte (9), Galapagos (7), Almirall (6) and Biocryst (5). A total of 98 patents are reviewed herein. EXPERT OPINION: JAK inhibitor therapy is entering a significant new era with the advent on the market of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, with unprecedented speed of development. Selectivity against the four individual JAK family enzymes, JAK1, 2, 3 and TYK2, is now a key goal since they each play subtly different roles in cytokine-induced cell signaling. The future looks bright for patients as many new drugs are being developed and now combinations of JAK inhibitors with other targeted agents are being studied in the clinic.

It was also shown that the hemopexin-like (PEX) domain and the fibronectin-like (FnII) module in the enzyme are involved in the heteromer formation. In the present work we show that reduction sensitive and SDS-stable heteromers can be reconstituted in vitro by mixing proMMP-9 with either serglycin, versican or CSPGs isolated from various monocytic cell lines. In addition, a strong but SDS-soluble proMMP-9\u00b7CSPG heteromer was formed. The two macromolecules in the SDS-stable reduction sensitive heteromers were not linked together by disulphide bonds. As for the heteromer isolated from THP-1 cells, the in vitro reconstituted SDS-stable and SDS-soluble heteromers had a weaker binding to gelatin than the proMMP-9 monomer. Furthermore, gelatin inhibited the in vitro reconstitution of the heteromers, showing that the FnII module is involved in the complex formation. TIMP-1 could not be detected in the formed proMMP-9\u00b7CSPG complexes. However, the presence of TIMP-1 inhibited the formation of the SDS-soluble heteromer, but not the SDS-stable reduction sensitive heteromer.

Mifepristone (RU 486), a first-in-class glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2012 for use in Cushing's syndrome to control hyperglycemia in patients who are not surgical candidates or have not achieved remission from surgery. The drug is approved for oral once-daily administration. In its pivotal trial, 60% of patients responded to mifepristone with significant improvements in glycemic control and 38% had a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. The most common adverse events were nausea, fatigue, headache, endometrial hyperplasia, and hypokalemia. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in fewer than\u00a05% of patients. The recommended starting dosage of mifepristone is 300\u00a0mg/day. The dosage may be increased every 2-4\u00a0weeks up to a maximum of 1200\u00a0mg/day, although it should not exceed 20\u00a0mg/kg/day. Significant drug-drug interactions exist due to mifepristone's effects on a number of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Despite its limitations, mifepristone is a welcome addition and an appropriate alternative to the available drug therapy for Cushing's syndrome.", "anno": [[108, 109, true], [238, 239, true], [387, 388, true], [506, 507, true], [797, 798, true], [854, 855, true], [1021, 1022, true], [1126, 1127, true], [1187, 1188, true], [1250, 1251, true], [1370, 1371, true], [1481, 1482, true], [1626, 1627, true]]}, {"id": 23017411, "text": "The formation of supramolecular inclusion complexes between rutin and four cyclodextrins, namely \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD), (2-hydroxypropyl)-\u03b1-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b1-CD), (2-hydroxypropyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) and (2-hydroxypropyl)-\u03b3-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b3-CD), and the effects of the complexation on the stability and antioxidant activity of rutin were investigated.

While the short-term efficacy of NRT is well documented in clinical trials, long-term abstinence rates associated with using NRT are modest, as most smokers will relapse. This literature review examines emerging clinical strategies to improve NRT efficacy. After an initial overview of NRT and its FDA-approved indications for use, we review randomized trials in which clinical delivery of NRT was manipulated and tested, in an attempt to enhance efficacy, through (1) duration of use (pre-quit and extended use), (2) amount of use (high-dose and combination NRT), (3) tailoring to specific smoker groups (genotype and phenotype), or (4) use of NRT for novel purposes (relapse prevention, temporary abstinence, cessation induction). Outcomes vary within and across topic area, and we highlight areas that offer stronger promise. Combination NRT likely represents the most promising strategy moving forward; other clinical strategies offer conflicting evidence but deserve further testing (pre-quit NRT or tailored treatment) or offer potential utility but are in need of further, direct tests. Some areas, though based on a limited set of studies, do not offer great promise (high-dose and extended treatment NRT).

An extensive optimization of the assay enabled its efficient use in HTS (Z' = 0.7 in the 384-well format). HTS of 2560 small molecules to search for inhibitory compounds yielded several hits, including suramin, doxorubicin and ellagic acid. We demonstrate that these three compounds inhibit Mtb DnaG. Both suramin and doxorubicin are potent (low-\u00b5M) DNA- and nucleotide triphosphate-competitive priming inhibitors that interact with more than one site on Mtb DnaG. This novel assay should be applicable to other primases and inefficient DNA/RNA polymerases, facilitating their characterization and inhibitor discovery.", "anno": [[91, 92, true], [276, 277, true], [347, 348, true], [439, 440, true], [568, 569, true], [773, 774, true], [880, 881, true], [1014, 1015, true], [1074, 1075, true], [1238, 1239, true], [1392, 1393, true]]}, {"id": 23534403, "text": "Extended H\u00fcckel theory (EHT) is a well established method for the description of the electronic structure of molecules and solids.

This work demonstrates that high friction coefficients between the surfaces do not necessarily correlate with surface damage and that chemically grafted HA acts synergistically with Lub to provide friction reduction and enhanced wear protection to the surfaces. Surface immobilization of HA by grafting is necessary for such wear protection. Increasing the concentration of Lub enhances the threshold load that a chemically grafted HA surface can be subjected to before the onset of wear. Addition of Lub does not have any beneficial effect if HA is physisorbed to the mica surfaces. Damage occurs at loads less than 1 mN regardless of the amount of Lub, indicating that the molecules in the bulk play little or no role in protecting the surfaces from damage. Lub penetrates into the chemically bound HA to form a visco-elastic gel that reduces the coefficient of friction as well as boosts the strength of the surface against abrasive wear (damage).", "anno": [[285, 286, true], [547, 548, true], [627, 628, true], [774, 775, true], [869, 870, true], [1045, 1046, true], [1236, 1237, true]]}, {"id": 23603477, "text": "Jellyfish venom contains various toxins and can cause itching, edema, muscle aches, shortness of breath, blood pressure depression, shock or even death after being stung. Hemolytic protein is one of the most hazardous components in the venom. The present study investigated the hemolytic activity of the nematocyst venom from jellyfish Stomolophus meleagris. Anion exchange chromatography, DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow, and gel filtration chromatography, Superdex200 had been employed to isolate hemolytic proteins from the nematocyst venom of jellyfish S. meleagris. Hemolysis of chicken red blood cells was used to quantify hemolytic potency of crude nematocyst venom and chromatography fractions during the purification process. Native-PAGE profile displayed one protein band in the purified hemolytic protein (SmTX); however, two protein bands with apparent molecular weights of \u223c45kDa and 52kDa were observed in the reducing SDS-PAGE analysis. Approximately 70\u03bcg/mL of SmTX caused 50% hemolysis (HU50) of the erythrocyte suspension. The hemolytic activity of SmTX was shown to be temperature and pH dependent, with the optimum temperature and pH being 37\u00b0C and pH 5.0.

However, causes of FSH dysregulation are poorly described, in part because of our incomplete understanding of mechanisms controlling FSH synthesis. Previously, we discovered a critical role for forkhead protein L2 (FOXL2) in activin-stimulated FSH \u03b2-subunit (Fshb) transcription in immortalized cells in vitro. Here, we tested the hypothesis that FOXL2 is required for FSH synthesis in vivo. Using a Cre/lox approach, we selectively ablated Foxl2 in murine anterior pituitary gonadotrope cells. Conditional knockout (cKO) mice developed overtly normally but were subfertile in adulthood. Testis size and spermatogenesis were significantly impaired in cKO males. cKO females exhibited reduced ovarian weight and ovulated fewer oocytes in natural estrous cycles compared with controls. In contrast, ovaries of juvenile cKO females showed normal responses to exogenous gonadotropin stimulation. Both male and female cKO mice were FSH deficient, secondary to diminished pituitary Fshb mRNA production. Basal and activin-stimulated Fshb expression was similarly impaired in Foxl2 depleted primary pituitary cultures. Collectively, these data definitively establish FOXL2 as the first identified gonadotrope-restricted transcription factor required for selective FSH synthesis in vivo.", "anno": [[66, 67, true], [214, 215, true], [377, 378, true], [458, 459, true], [561, 562, true], [654, 655, true], [728, 729, true], [850, 851, true], [958, 959, true], [1064, 1065, true], [1178, 1179, true], [1346, 1347, true]]}]}
