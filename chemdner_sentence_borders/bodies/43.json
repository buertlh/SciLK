Recently, a downregulation in the expression of GABAergic genes (i.e., glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 and reelin) associated with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) overexpression in GABAergic neurons has been regarded as a characteristic phenotypic component of the neuropathology of psychotic disorders (Guidotti et\u00a0al.,\u00a02011). Here, we characterized mice exposed to prenatal restraint stress (PRS) in order to study neurochemical and behavioral abnormalities related to development of schizophrenia in the adult. Offspring born from non-stressed mothers (control mice) showed high levels of DNMT1 and 3a mRNA expression in the frontal cortex at birth, but these levels progressively decreased at post-natal days (PND) 7, 14, and 60. Offspring born from stressed mothers (PRS mice) showed increased levels of DNMTs compared to controls at all time-points studied including at birth and at PND 60. Using GAD67-GFP transgenic mice, we established that, in both control and PRS mice, high levels of DNMT1 and 3a were preferentially expressed in GABAergic neurons of frontal cortex and hippocampus. Importantly, the overexpression of DNMT in GABAergic neurons was associated with a decrease in reelin and GAD67 expression in PRS mice in early and adult life. PRS mice also showed an increased binding of DNMT1 and MeCP2, and an increase in 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in specific CpG-rich regions of the reelin and GAD67 promoters. Thus, the epigenetic changes in PRS mice are similar to changes observed in the post-mortem brains of psychiatric patients. Behaviorally, adult PRS mice showed hyperactivity and deficits in social interaction, prepulse inhibition, and fear conditioning that were corrected by administration of valproic acid (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) or clozapine (an atypical antipsychotic with DNA-demethylation activity). Taken together, these data show that prenatal stress in mice induces abnormalities in the DNA methylation network and in behaviors indicative of a schizophrenia-like phenotype. Thus, PRS mice may be a valid model for the investigation of new drugs for schizophrenia treatment targeting DNA methylation.

METHODS: Systematic search for epidemiologic studies was carried out and the data were collected from MEDLINE database and from the reference lists of relevant studies. Data were extracted from 20 included studies published between 1986 and 2012. RESULTS: The meta-analysis suggested a significant association between lymphoma and workers' occupational exposing to PCP, for the pooled odds ratio = 2.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.52-4.35). The subgroup analysis indicated significant association for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but not for Hodgkin's disease. The cohort studies also showed comparatively higher relative risk (RR) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Two of the cohort studies found increased RR as the cumulative exposure time added. Another cohort study discovered that the white males had significantly elevated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality (SMR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.15-3.17), and males of other races had increased leukemia mortality (SMR = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.25-11.7). For the relationship of childhood leukemia and parental exposure to PCP, three published studies suggested an increased risk of childhood leukemia because of their parental exposure to PCP at the preconception period.

IL-1\u03b2 exerts its effects through interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) and interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which together form a heterotrimeric signaling-competent complex. Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies. Canakinumab is known to neutralize IL-1\u03b2 by competing for binding to IL-1R and therefore blocking signaling by the antigen:antibody complex. Gevokizumab is claimed to be a regulatory therapeutic antibody that modulates IL-1\u03b2 bioactivity by reducing the affinity for its IL-1RI:IL-1RAcP signaling complex. How IL-1\u03b2 signaling is affected by both canakinumab and gevokizumab was not yet experimentally determined. We have analyzed the crystal structures of canakinumab and gevokizumab antibody binding fragment (Fab) as well as of their binary complexes with IL-1\u03b2. Furthermore, we characterized the epitopes on IL-1\u03b2 employed by the antibodies by NMR epitope mapping studies. The direct comparison of NMR and X-ray data shows that the epitope defined by the crystal structure encompasses predominantly those residues whose NMR resonances are severely perturbed upon complex formation. The antigen:Fab co-structures confirm the previously identified key contact residues on IL-1\u03b2 and provide insight into the mechanisms leading to their distinct modulation of IL-1\u03b2 signaling. A significant steric overlap of the binding interfaces of IL-1R and canakinumab on IL-1\u03b2 causes competitive inhibition of the association of IL-1\u03b2 and its receptor.

As data on phytoestrogens continues to accumulate, it is clear that there is significant overlap in the cellular effects elicited by these various compounds. Here, we show that one mechanism by which a number of phytoestrogens achieve their growth inhibitory and cytoprotective effects is via induction of the mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Eight phytoestrogens, including resveratrol, coumestrol, kaempferol, genistein, daidzein, apigenin, isoliquirtigenin and glycitin, were tested for their ability to induce MnSOD expression in mouse C2C12 and primary myoblasts. Five of these, resveratrol, coumestrol, kaempferol, genistein and daidzein, significantly increased MnSOD expression, slowed proliferative growth and enhanced stress resistance (hydrogen peroxide LD50) . When siRNA was used to prevent the MnSOD induction by genistein, coumestrol or daidzein, none of these compounds exerted any effect on proliferative growth, and only the effect of coumestrol on stress resistance persisted. The estrogen antagonist ICI182780 prevented the increased MnSOD expression and also the changes in cell growth and stress resistance, indicating that these effects are mediated by estrogen receptors (ER). The absence of effects of resveratrol or coumestrol, but not genistein, in ER\u03b2-null cells further indicated that this ER in particular is important in mediating these effects. Thus, an ER-mediated induction of MnSOD expression appears to underlie the growth inhibitory and cytoprotective activities of multiple phytoestrogens.

The structure in solution of both amylosucrases during the reaction was shown to be similar to the known crystallographic structures. The conformation of amylose produced at an early stage consists of a mixture of wormlike chains and double helical cylindrical structures. In the case of NpAS, in a second stage, individual double helices pack into clusters before crystallizing and precipitating. Amylose produced by DgAS never self-associates in such clusters due to the higher temperature used for amylose synthesis.

With further development of novel, selective agonists and antagonists, our understanding will continue to improve and further therapeutic applications are likely to be discovered.", "anno": [[237, 238, true], [461, 462, true], [701, 702, true], [881, 882, true]]}, {"id": 23132909, "text": "The objective of this study was to establish the role of apoA-IV, ABCA1, and LCAT in the biogenesis of apoA-IV-containing HDL (HDL-A-IV) using different mouse models. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of apoA-IV in apoA-I(-/-) mice did not change plasma lipid levels. ApoA-IV floated in the HDL2/HDL3 region, promoted the formation of spherical HDL particles as determined by electron microscopy, and generated mostly \u03b1- and a few pre-\u03b2-like HDL subpopulations. Gene transfer of apoA-IV in apoA-I(-/-) \u00d7 apoE(-/-) mice increased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and 80% of the protein was distributed in the VLDL/IDL/LDL region. This treatment likewise generated \u03b1- and pre-\u03b2-like HDL subpopulations. Spherical and \u03b1-migrating HDL particles were not detectable following gene transfer of apoA-IV in ABCA1(-/-) or LCAT(-/-) mice. Coexpression of apoA-IV and LCAT in apoA-I(-/-) mice restored the formation of HDL-A-IV. Lipid-free apoA-IV and reconstituted HDL-A-IV promoted ABCA1 and scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI)-mediated cholesterol efflux, respectively, as efficiently as apoA-I and apoE. Our findings are consistent with a novel function of apoA-IV in the biogenesis of discrete HDL-A-IV particles with the participation of ABCA1 and LCAT, and may explain previously reported anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective properties of apoA-IV.", "anno": [[165, 166, true], [266, 267, true], [460, 461, true], [638, 639, true], [710, 711, true], [838, 839, true], [927, 928, true], [1100, 1101, true], [1350, 1351, true]]}, {"id": 23369072, "text": "Environmentally friendly poly(butylenesuccinate-co-butyleneazelate) (P(BS-co-BAz)s) aliphatic copolyesters with composition-dependent thermomechanical properties were synthesized from succinic acid (SuA), 1,4-butanediol (BDO), and dimethylazelate (DMAz) through a two-step polycondensation reaction. The molar SuA/AzA ratio was varied from 4:1 to 1:4, and the chemical structure and molecular characteristics of resulting (co)polyesters were characterized by NMR and SEC, whereas thermal properties and crystallinity were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analyses (DMTA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A good agreement between theoretical and experimental SuA/AzA molar ratios in the copolyesters was achieved, together with the recovery of semicrystalline random copolymers of uniform composition along the chains. NMR, DSC, DMTA, and XRD results show that depending on their composition the P(BS-co-BAz) copolyesters might find applications from elastomers to high-impact thermoplastics.", "anno": [[298, 299, true], [645, 646, true], [859, 860, true], [1033, 1034, true]]}]}
