We reviewed published clinical trials and conference proceedings examining combinations of targeted therapies across different breast cancer subtypes.

Diquat is a non-selective herbicide used for crop protection or for weed control in such water bodies. In this study, we investigated the effects of diquat on a widely spread aquatic invertebrate, the holarctic freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Due to the known redox-cycling properties of diquat, we studied transcript expression and enzymatic activities relative to oxidative and general stress in the haemolymph and gonado-digestive complex (GDC). As diquat is not persistent, snails were exposed for short times (5, 24, and 48 h) to ecologically relevant concentrations (22.2, 44.4, and 222.2 \u03bcg l(-1)) of diquat dibromide. RT-qPCR was used to quantify the transcription of genes encoding catalase (cat), a cytosolic superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-sod), a selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (gpx), a glutathione reductase (gred), the retinoid X receptor (rxr), two heat shock proteins (hsp40 and hsp70), cortactin (cor) and the two ribosomal genes r18S and r28s. Enzymatic activities of SOD, Gpx, Gred and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were investigated in the GDC using spectrophoto/fluorometric methods. Opposite trends were obtained in the haemolymph depending on the herbicide concentration. At the lowest concentration, effects were mainly observed after 24 h of exposure, with over-transcription of cor, hsp40, rxr, and sod, whereas higher concentrations down-regulated the expression of most of the studied transcripts, especially after 48 h of exposure. In the GDC, earlier responses were observed and the fold-change magnitude was generally much higher: transcription of all target genes increased significantly (or non-significantly for cat) after 5 h of exposure, and went back to control levels afterwards, suggesting the onset of an early response to oxidative stress associated to the unbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hepatocytes. Although increases obtained for Gred and SOD activities were globally consistent with their respective transcript expressions, up-regulation of transcription was not always correlated with increase of enzymatic activity, indicating that diquat might affect steps downstream of transcription.

To gain insight into mechanisms of liposomal CDDP activity, we performed a transcriptome analysis of untreated A2780cis cells, and A2780cis cells in response to exposure with IC50 values of free or liposomal CDDP. A process network analysis of upregulated genes showed that liposomal CDDP induced a highly different gene expression profile in comparison to the free drug. p53 was identified as a key player directing transcriptional responses to free or liposomal CDDP. The free drug induced expression of essential genes of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway (BAX, BID, CASP9) most likely through p38MAPK activation. In contrast, liposomal CDDP induced expression of genes from DNA damage pathways and several genes of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (TNFRSF10B-DR5, CD70-TNFSF7). It thus appears that liposomal CDDP overcomes CDDP resistance by inducing DNA damage and in consequence programmed cell death by the extrinsic pathway.

Major aim of islet transplantation is to achieve successful insulin independent disease free survival. The key challenges in transplanted islets are the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and associated oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokine - (TNF\u03b1) mediated apoptotic induction, attack by immune cells, and achieving revascularization with minimal hypoxic microenvironment. Free radicals and their derivatives are constantly produced in living systems, but at relatively low level, and in a balanced state. Oxidative stress, which occurs as a result of an imbalance between the intracellular free radicals production and the cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms in the transplanted islets, can lead to cell death. The balance between oxidants and antioxidants in a cell can be easily disturbed by increase in ROS production or reduction in the level of cellular antioxidant defensive substances, which can cause many metabolic complications, including pancreatic \u03b2-cell damage. Antioxidants function as blockers of radical processes by eliminating harmful ROS produced during normal cellular metabolism. A complex antioxidant defense mechanism has been developed by nature in cells to protect the cellular homeostasis. This system mainly includes antioxidant enzymes, vitamins and minerals. As transplanted islet survival is crucial for achieving successful therapy, most of these antioxidants can be used as a supplement to scavenge the local ROS thereby improving the survival of transplanted islets. Currently, very few techniques have been routinely used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the survival and function of islet grafts, especially to confirm the success of treatment, which includes metabolic parameters such as blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels.

The purpose of the present study was to identify important anticancer herbs used in TCM and carry out bioactivity-directed fractionation and isolation (BDFI) using six cancer cell lines as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), to identify constituents with anticancer activity but devoid of toxic effects against healthy immune cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 243 document anticancer TCM treatments, 199 anticancer TCM herbs were ranked by the number of literature reports for each herb. Five herbs were identified from the top 50 ranked herbs by at least two out of three TCM practitioners as frequently used in the TCM treatment of cancer. BDFI using MTS assay was applied to determine the active anticancer extracts, fractions, and finally discrete compounds. RESULTS: Five herbs were selected for study of their anticancer activities. The extracts of Curcuma longa L., Scutellaria barbata D. Don, and Hedyotis diffusa showed antiproliferative activity to various extents, extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and Solanum nigrum L. showed little anticancer activity. Seven out of the 21 fractions obtained from Hedyotis diffusa showed anticancer activity.

We found that TPA (100\u00a0ng/ml) induced MMP-9 enzyme activity both dose- and time-dependently, and 200\u00a0\u03bcM DHA and LA significantly inhibited MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression, enzyme activity, cell migration, and invasion. Treatment with PD98059 (10\u00a0\u03bcM), wortmannin (10\u00a0\u03bcM), and GF109203X (0.5\u00a0\u03bcM) decreased TPA-induced MMP-9 protein expression and enzyme activity. TPA-induced activation of ERK1, Akt, and PKC\u03b4 was attenuated by DHA, whereas LA attenuated only ERK1 activation. GF109203X also suppressed ERK1 activation. EMSA showed that DHA, LA, PD98059, and wortmannin decreased TPA-induced NF-\u03baB and AP-1 DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, DHA rather than LA dose-dependently increased HO-1 expression. HO-1 siRNA alleviated the inhibition by DHA of TPA-induced MMP-9 protein expression and enzyme activity in MCF-7 cells, and HO-1 knockdown reversed the DHA inhibition of cell migration. These results suggest that DHA and LA have both similar and divergent signaling pathways in the suppression of TPA-induced MCF-7 metastasis.", "anno": [[75, 76, true], [325, 326, true], [447, 448, true], [668, 669, true], [811, 812, true], [924, 925, true], [967, 968, true], [1076, 1077, true], [1152, 1153, true], [1338, 1339, true], [1479, 1480, true]]}, {"id": 23631425, "text": "AFM measurements of the force acting between silica surfaces in the presence of varied alkali-chloride salts and pH's elucidate the origin of the Hofmeister adsorption series and its reversal.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the estrogenic properties and neuroprotective effects of Cyperi Rhizoma under estrogen-deprived condition in female mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the estrogen-like effect of Cyperi Rhizoma extract (CRE), we measured luciferase expression after transfection of a promoter construct containing an estrogen response element (ERE) and treatment of CRE. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of CRE, we measured striatal dopamine, movement ability, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, and apoptosis-related protein expression levels after treatment of CRE either with or without 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in ovariectomized female mice. RESULTS: CRE significantly induced the luciferase expression driven by an ERE in PC12 cells, a dopaminergic cell line, in a dose-dependent manner. In mice, MPTP significantly decreased the levels of dopamine in the striatum and behavior performance; in contrast, both CRE and 17\u03b2-estradiol benzoate (EB) recovered these parameters to normal levels. CRE and EB treatment also recovered TH immunopositive fibers and cells, respectively, from MPTP toxicity.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In 1998, 1,143 primary care patients with type 2 diabetes participated in the ZODIAC study. Because blood was drawn for 867 patients (76%) and confounders were missing for 19 patients, the final study sample comprised 848 patients. After a follow-up time of 10 years, we used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the relationship between MR-proANP and (cardiovascular) mortality. Harrell C statistic was used to compare models with and without MR-proANP. The regression analyses were repeated without MR-proANP for patients aged older than 75 years. RESULTS Median MR-proANP in the total study sample was 75 pmol/L (interquartile range, 48-124 pmol/L). During follow-up, 354 (42%) out of 848 patients had died, of whom 152 (43%) deaths were attributable to cardiovascular factors.

The implications of these findings to personalize genome analyses of an individual patient's tumor are also discussed.Oncogene advance online publication, 18 February 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.29.", "anno": [[142, 143, true], [290, 291, true], [539, 540, true], [658, 659, true], [737, 738, true]]}]}
