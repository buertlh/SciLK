METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received five nicotine (0.0, 0.2 or 0.4\u00a0mg/kg), TPM (containing 0.2 or 0.4\u00a0mg/kg nicotine) or methamphetamine (0.5\u00a0mg/kg) injections every second day, followed by a 4-day withdrawal before the first challenge (Challenge 1, C1).

RESULTS: There were no major differences in sensitisation profile between nicotine and TPM. At the lowest 0.2\u00a0mg/kg nicotine/TPM dose, however, small differences emerged on select test days. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the non-nicotinic agents in TPM did not greatly impact the nicotine-produced locomotor-sensitised response. These findings might suggest that the differential pharmacological properties of TPM do not have major clinical significance.

We developed a human tissue-based system to study lymphocyte recruitment in response to ethanol challenge. Precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) from human livers were incubated in culture, and hepatic function was determined by albumin production, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, glucose uptake responses, and morphometric assessment. Responses of tissue and lymphocytes to ethanol exposure were determined by PCR, flow cytometry, histology, and lymphocyte infiltration assays. Human PCLS demonstrated appropriate upregulation of CYP2E1, ADH1\u03b1, and ADH3 in response to ethanol treatment. Ethanol also induced expression of endothelial VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, production of sICAM-1 and CXCL8, and the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4 on CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes.

Rebinding dynamics at 77K, 180K, and 300K exhibits changes in both timescale and mechanism as the protein and solvent undergo a dynamic \"glass transition.\" At each temperature, the rebinding dynamics yields a subset of trajectories that undergo fast rebinding as well as a subset of trajectories that undergo slower rebinding. At 300K in water, both a fast (4.0 ps) and slow (14.6 ps) rebinding is observed. While fast rebinding occurs from a \"downward\" (heme pointing) substate of the methionine, the slow rebinding involves interconversion between an \"upward\" substate, from which rebinding cannot occur, and the downward substate. At lower temperatures (77K and 180K) the upward dissociated substate was not observed due to the high barrier imposed by the \"frozen\" protein structure. However, a slow rebinding phase is observed at both 77K and 180K and is associated with a process of trapping in downward but \"binding forbidden\" substates with subsequent slow dynamical conversion to \"binding competent\" substates from which rebinding is relatively rapid.

Although human MMR has been reconstituted in\u00a0vitro, how MMR occurs in\u00a0vivo is unknown. Here, we show that an epigenetic histone mark, H3K36me3, is required in\u00a0vivo to recruit the mismatch recognition protein hMutS\u03b1 (hMSH2-hMSH6) onto chromatin through direct interactions with the hMSH6 PWWP domain. The abundance of H3K36me3 in G1 and early S phases ensures that hMutS\u03b1 is enriched on chromatin before mispairs are introduced during DNA replication. Cells lacking the H3K36 trimethyltransferase SETD2 display microsatellite instability (MSI) and an elevated spontaneous mutation frequency, characteristic of MMR-deficient cells.

METHODS: We compared the displacement of radioligand binding to various mammalian CNS sites, acute stimulation of accumbens shell dopamine levels, and place conditioning in rats among cocaine and four BZT analogs with Cl substitutions on the diphenyl-ether system including two with carboalkoxy substitutions at the 2-position of the tropane ring. RESULTS: Binding assays confirmed high-affinity and selectivity for the DAT with the BZT analogs which also produced significant stimulation of mesolimbic dopamine efflux. Because BZT analogs produced temporal patterns of extracellular dopamine levels different from those by cocaine (3-10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.), the place conditioning produced by BZT analogs and cocaine was compared at doses and times at which both the increase in dopamine levels and rates of increase were similar to those produced by an effective dose of cocaine.

Here we tested the hypothesis that functional AR in the brain contributes to whole-body insulin sensitivity regulation and to the metabolic abnormalities developed in AR-deficient male mice. The mouse model selectively lacking AR in the central nervous system and AR-expressing GT1-7 neuronal cells were established and used to delineate molecular mechanisms in insulin signaling modulated by AR. Neuronal AR deficiency leads to reduced insulin sensitivity in middle-aged mice. Neuronal AR regulates hypothalamic insulin signaling by repressing nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-mediated induction of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Hypothalamic insulin resistance leads to hepatic insulin resistance, lipid accumulation, and visceral obesity. The functional deficiency of AR in the hypothalamus leads to male mice being more susceptible to the effects of high-fat diet consumption on PTP1B expression and NF-\u03baB activation. These findings suggest that in men with PCa undergoing ADT, reduction of AR function in the brain may contribute to insulin resistance and visceral obesity.
