A number of bis- and tris-xylosides, but not mono-xylosides, caused an elongation phenotype upon their injection into embryos. In situ hybridization showed that elongated embryos have elevated expression of the FGF target gene mkp3 but unchanged expression of reporters for other pathways, indicating that FGF/FGFR signaling was specifically hyperactivated. In support of this observation, elongation can be reversed by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU5402, mRNA for the FGFR antagonist sprouty4, or FGF8 morpholino.

Although fisetin greatly increases the stability of both Nrf2 and ATF4, only the effect on ATF4 is dependent on protein kinase activity. Using siRNA we found that ATF4, but not Nrf2, is important for fisetin's ability to increase GSH levels under basal conditions whereas both ATF4 and Nrf2 appear to cooperate to increase GSH levels under oxidative stress conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in rats was ligated to make an animal model of CHF. From this, electrocardiographic parameters and exterior signs of rat hearts were recorded. Additionally, the histopathology of heart tissues was examined, and parameters of inflammatory stress were measured. Experiments were performed over two months in LAD-ligation rats treated with YQFM or vehicle. Treatment with Captopril was used as a positive control, which has previously been shown to prevent CHF, and rats without LAD-ligation were used as a negative control. Furthermore, we screened and identified potential anti-inflammatory constituents by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) combined with NF-\u03baB activity luciferase reporter assay systems. Further cytokine detection confirmed the anti-inflammatory effects of the potential NF-\u03baB inhibitors from YQFM.

RESULTS: Glucose intolerance developed within 3\u00a0days of the HFD and did not deteriorate further in the period to 12\u00a0weeks. Whole-body insulin resistance, measured by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, was detected after 1\u00a0week of HFD and was due to hepatic insulin resistance. Adipose tissue was insulin resistant after 1\u00a0week, while skeletal muscle displayed insulin resistance at 3\u00a0weeks, coinciding with a defect in glucose disposal.

Here we identify the serine/threonine kinase homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) as a corepressor that inhibits myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2)-dependent gene expression in undifferentiated myoblasts. Downregulation of HIPK2 expression by shRNAs results in elevated expression of muscle-specific genes, whereas overexpression of the kinase dampens transcription of these genes. HIPK2 is constitutively associated with a multi-protein complex containing histone deacetylase (HDAC)3 and HDAC4 that serves to silence MEF2C-dependent transcription in undifferentiated myoblasts. HIPK2 interferes with gene expression on phosphorylation and HDAC3-dependent deacetylation of MEF2C. Ongoing muscle differentiation is accompanied by elevated caspase activity, which results in caspase-mediated cleavage of HIPK2 following aspartic acids 916 and 977 and the generation of a C-terminally truncated HIPK2 protein. The short form of the kinase loses its affinity to the repressive multi-protein complex and its ability to bind HDAC3 and HDAC4, thus alleviating its repressive function for expression of muscle genes. This study identifies HIPK2 as a further protein that determines the threshold and kinetics of gene expression in proliferating myoblasts and during the initial steps of myogenesis.", "anno": [[175, 176, true], [390, 391, true], [567, 568, true], [764, 765, true], [865, 866, true], [1092, 1093, true], [1294, 1295, true], [1476, 1477, true]]}, {"id": 23620478, "text": "OBJECTIVETo examine the interactive relationship between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) in type 2 diabetic patients, and to elucidate the role of DR and microalbuminuria on the onset of macroalbuminuria and renal function decline.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe explored the effects of DR and microalbuminuria on the progression of DN from normoalbuminuria and low microalbuminuria (<150 mg/gCr) to macroalbuminuria or renal function decline in the Japan Diabetes Complications Study (JDCS), which is a nationwide randomized controlled study of type 2 diabetic patients focusing on lifestyle modification. Patients were divided into four groups according to presence or absence of DR and MA: normoalbuminuria without DR [NA(DR-)] (n = 773), normoalbuminuria with DR [NA(DR+)] (n = 279), microalbuminuria without DR [MA(DR-)] (n = 277), and microalbuminuria with DR [MA(DR+)] (n = 146). Basal urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and DR status were determined at baseline and followed for a median of 8.0 years.RESULTSAnnual incidence rates of macroalbuminuria were 1.6/1,000 person-years (9 incidences), 3.9/1,000 person-years (8 incidences), 18.4/1,000 person-years (34 incidences), and 22.1/1,000 person-years (22 incidences) in the four groups, respectively. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios of the progression to macroalbuminuria were 2.48 (95% CI 0.94-6.50; P = 0.07), 10.40 (4.91-22.03; P < 0.01), and 11.55 (5.24-25.45; P < 0.01) in NA(DR+), MA(DR-), and MA(DR+), respectively, in comparison with NA(DR-).

Consideration of reversible inhibition by omeprazole and its metabolites would not identify DDI risk with CYP3A4, and with CYP2C19 reversible inhibition values would only identify DDI risk if the metabolites are included in the assessment. Based on inactivation data, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inactivation by omeprazole would be sufficient to identify risk, but metabolites were predicted to contribute 30-63% to the in vivo hepatic interactions.

However, its antiaggressive action has not been unequivocally demonstrated in male laboratory rodents. OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal was to examine the putative serenic effect of oxytocin in a feral strain (wild type Groningen, WTG) of rats that generally show a much broader variation and higher levels of intermale aggression than commonly used laboratory strains of rats. METHODS: Resident animals were intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered with different doses of synthetic oxytocin and oxytocin receptor antagonist, alone and in combination, in order to manipulate brain oxytocin functioning and to assess their behavioral response to an intruder. RESULTS: Our data clearly demonstrate that acute icv administered oxytocin produces dose-dependent and receptor-selective changes in social behavior, reducing aggression and potentiating social exploration. These antiaggressive effects are stronger in the more offensive rats. On the other hand, administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist tends to increase (nonsignificantly) aggression only in low-medium aggressive animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that transiently enhancing brain oxytocin function has potent antiaggressive effects, whereas its attenuation tends to enhance aggressiveness. In addition, a possible inverse relationship between trait aggression and endogenous oxytocinergic signaling is revealed. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of brain oxytocinergic signaling for regulating intermale offensive aggression.

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases were used to retrieve all relevant articles published in the English language over the last 5\u00a0years (January 2008-October 2012). Eligibility criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sequential and standard triple therapies in patients with documented H. pylori infection. Eligibility and quality of the trials were assessed independently by two reviewers, and the data regarding eradication rate, adverse effects and the cost of therapy were extracted. RESULTS: Of the 17 RCTs included in the analysis (Asia 13, Europe 3, Latin America, 1), 12 reported better eradication rates with the sequential therapy, four did not find a significant difference between the two treatment regimens, and one reported a better eradication rate with standard triple therapy. All except one RCT reported no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects between standard triple therapy and sequential therapy. Sequential therapy was cheaper than standard triple therapy in all three RCTs where a cost analysis was performed. The limitations of the RCTs included in the systematic review were that the sequential therapy regimen and the duration of standard triple therapy were not uniform.

Samples of tissues were also used to estimate Cr accumulation and alterations in zinc, copper, and iron levels. The acute Cr(VI) exposure caused an increase in both hepatic and renal LP (by 70%, p < 0.01 and by 15%, p < 0.05, respectively), increased hepatic GSH level and GPx-1 activity, and decreased renal GPx-1 activity. The activity of GR was not changed. A significant inhibitory effect of Cr(VI) was found on TrxR-1 activity in both the liver and the kidneys.

Isolated coronary segments were subjected to concentration-response curves to acetylcholine (ACh) in the presence or absence of L-NAME (100\u03bcmol), enalaprilate (10\u03bcM), losartan (10\u03bcM), and spironolactone (100\u03bcM). Salt intake did not increase blood pressure in old SHRs, but caused ventricular hypertrophy. The endothelium-dependent relaxation in SHRs was lower than in Wistar rats. However, salt intake did not add further impairment. Both enalaprilate and losartan reduced the vasodilator response in coronary arteries from Wistar, but did not affect SHR-salt rats. Conversely, losartan attenuated the impaired ACh relaxation observed in SHR. Spironolactone reduced the relaxation induced by ACh in coronary arteries from Wistar rats but not in SHR. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system participates in the impaired coronary relaxation in aged SHR, but does not participate in deleterious effects under increased salt intake, indicating that age could differentiate the effects of high sodium intake in coronary arteries of SHR.", "anno": [[108, 109, true], [220, 221, true], [312, 313, true], [524, 525, true], [617, 618, true], [693, 694, true], [746, 747, true], [878, 879, true], [955, 956, true], [1062, 1063, true], [1345, 1346, true]]}, {"id": 23628508, "text": "Aspidin BB, an effective phloroglucinol derivative from Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott, has been previously reported to exert high biological activities. In this study, we analyzed the underlying mechanisms of aspidin BB on human ovarian cancer cell line, HO-8910. Aspidin BB significantly inhibited HO-8910 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC50 values were 15.02, 25.79 and 68.81\u03bcM after 72, 48 and 24h treatment, respectively. Meanwhile, aspidin BB markedly induced apoptosis evidenced by characteristic apoptotic morphological changes, nuclear DNA fragmentation, annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) double staining and S peak. Western blot analysis showed that aspidin BB suppressed Bcl-2 expression and enhanced Bax expression to desintegrate the outer mitochondrial membrane, then caused cytochrome c release which led to the activation of effector caspase-3, and further cleaved the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) in the nucleus, finally induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, aspidin BB provoked S phase arrest in HO-8910 cells with up-regulation of pRb, E2F1, CDK2, cyclin E and cyclin A proteins. Taken together, these findings support the conclusion that aspidin BB exhibits cytotoxicity towards human ovarian cancer HO-8910 cells through induction of apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway and arresting cell cycle progression in S phase.", "anno": [[153, 154, true], [264, 265, true], [364, 365, true], [456, 457, true], [658, 659, true], [999, 1000, true], [1135, 1136, true], [1376, 1377, true]]}, {"id": 23628509, "text": "Despite cyclopenta-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP-PAHs) having been detected in the environment, the ability of these compounds to induce cellular and tissue responses remains poorly characterized. In this review, we look at the chemistry and biological activity of the cyclopenta[c]phenanthrenes (CP[c]Ph) as potential chemicals of concern in the process of risk assessment. The first part of the review deals with the environmental occurrence and chemistry of CP-PAHs, focusing on available methods of CP[c]Ph chemical synthesis. The most interesting structural feature of the CP[c]Ph is the presence of a pseudo fjord-region constructed by the cyclopentane ring. This compound can be treated either as a structurally similar one to B[c]Ph, or as a phenanthrene skeleton with an electrodonating alkyl substituent in the bay-region of the molecule. The second thread, providing available data on the adverse effects of CP[c]Ph compounds on cells and tissues of living organisms, mainly fish, improves our understanding of these possible environmental hazards. The data show that CP[c]Ph is less potent at inducing CYP1A gene expression in rainbow trout than benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a well-known Ah-receptor agonist. Interestingly, the CP[c]Ph dependent up-regulation of CYP1A mRNA is positively correlated with the incidences of clastogenic changes in rainbow trout erythrocytes. CP[c]Ph has, comparably to B[a]P, a potential to repress expression of tumor suppressor p53, in the head kidney of rainbow trout. Furthermore, estrogen responsive genes in fish liver, ER\u03b1 and VTG, are not induced by CP[c]Ph, suggesting that the compound has no endocrine disrupting potential. However, some CP[c]Phs show mutagenic activity when investigated in the Ames test, and exhibit genotoxic properties in in vitro micronucleus assay. The above characteristics suggest that CP-PAHs are chemicals of concern for which potential pathways of exposure should be further identified.", "anno": [[208, 209, true], [386, 387, true], [542, 543, true], [676, 677, true], [860, 861, true], [1071, 1072, true], [1227, 1228, true], [1391, 1392, true], [1521, 1522, true], [1684, 1685, true], [1832, 1833, true], [1975, 1976, true]]}, {"id": 23628605, "text": "Mitochondria are essential sites for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Mitochondria in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal, gonad, placenta and brain contain the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc, and its two electron-transfer partners, ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. This enzyme system converts cholesterol to pregnenolone and determines net steroidogenic capacity, so that it serves as the chronic regulator of steroidogenesis. Several other steroidogenic enzymes, including 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11\u03b2-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase also reside in mitochondria. Similarly, the mitochondria of renal tubular cells contain two key enzymes participating in the activation and degradation of vitamin D. The access of cholesterol to the mitochondria is regulated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR, serving as the acute regulator of steroidogenesis. StAR action requires a complex multi-component molecular machine on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Components of this machine include the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), the voltage-dependent anion chanel (VDAC-1), TSPO-associated protein 7 (PAP7, ACBD3), and protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1\u03b1 (PKAR1A). The precise fashion in which these proteins interact and move cholesterol from the OMM to P450scc, and the means by which cholesterol is loaded into the OMM, remain unclear. Human deficiency diseases have been described for StAR and for all the mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes, but not for the electron transfer proteins or for the components of the cholesterol import machine.", "anno": [[65, 66, true], [285, 286, true], [447, 448, true], [597, 598, true], [734, 735, true], [897, 898, true], [1005, 1006, true], [1218, 1219, true], [1392, 1393, true], [1600, 1601, true]]}]}
