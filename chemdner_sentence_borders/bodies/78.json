Pulsed hyperglycemia induced by daily administration of glucose during 3 days of development caused daily spikes in plasma glucose concentration. In a second model, sustained hyperglycemia was induced with a single injection of glucose into the yolk on day 0. The sustained model raised the average plasma glucose concentration from 70 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL and led to decreased gene expression of glucose transporter GLUT1. Both models of hyperglycemia reduced embryo size, increased mortality, and delayed development. Within the heart outflow tract, reduced proliferation of myocardial and endocardial cells resulted from the sustained hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. The cell cycle inhibitor p21 was significantly increased, whereas cyclin D1, a cell cycle promoter, decreased in sustained hyperglycemia compared with controls. The evidence suggests that hyperglycemia-induced developmental delays are associated with slowed cell cycle progression, leading to reduced cellular proliferation.

Surgically induced hormonal changes and the restrictive postoperative diet are proposed mechanisms. We evaluated the contribution of caloric restriction versus surgically induced changes to glucose homeostasis in the immediate postoperative period.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSPatients with type 2 diabetes planning to undergo RYGB participated in a prospective two-period study (each period involved a 10-day inpatient stay and periods were separated by a minimum of 6 weeks of wash-out) in which patients served as their own controls. The presurgery period consisted of diet alone. The postsurgery period was matched in all aspects (daily matched diet) and included RYGB surgery. Glucose measurements were performed every 4 h throughout the study. A mixed meal challenge test was performed before and after each period.RESULTSTen patients completed the study and had the following characteristics: age, 53.2 years (95% CI, 48.0-58.4); BMI, 51.2 kg/m(2) (46.1-56.4); diabetes duration, 7.4 years (4.8-10.0); and HbA1c, 8.52% (7.08-9.96). Patients lost 7.3 kg (8.1-6.5) during the presurgery period versus 4.0 kg (6.2-1.7) during the postsurgery period (P = 0.01 between periods). Daily glycemia in the presurgery period was significantly lower (1,293.58 mg/dL*day [1,096.83-1,490.33) vs. 1,478.80 mg/dL*day [1,277.47-1,680.13]) compared with the postsurgery period (P = 0.02 between periods). The improvements in the fasting and maximum poststimulation glucose and 6-h glucose area under the curve (primary outcome) were similar during both periods.CONCLUSIONSGlucose homeostasis improved in response to a reduced caloric diet, with a greater effect observed in the absence of surgery as compared with after RYGB.

Reproducibility imaging experiments were performed using structure and composition-realistic phantoms constructed from cadaveric radii. Single-center precision was determined by repeat scanning over short-term (<72\u2009hours), intermediate-term (3-5 months), and long-term intervals (28 months). Multicenter precision was determined by imaging the phantoms at nine different HR-pQCT centers. Least significant change (LSC) and root mean squared coefficient of variation (RMSCV) for each interval and across centers was calculated for bone density, geometry, microstructure, and biomechanical parameters. Single-center short-term RMSCVs were <1% for all parameters except cortical thickness (Ct.Th) (1.1%), spatial variability in cortical thickness (Ct.Th.SD) (2.6%), standard deviation of trabecular separation (Tb.Sp.SD) (1.8%), and porosity measures (6% to 8%).

Accumulating evidence from animal experiments has demonstrated that ketamine causes neuronal cell death during the brain growth spurt. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms associated with ketamine-induced neuronal toxicity and search for approaches or agents to prevent ketamine's adverse effects on the developing brain, a primary nerve cell culture system was utilized. Neurons harvested from the forebrain of newborn rats were maintained under normal control conditions or exposed to either ketamine (10 \u00b5M) or ketamine plus L-carnitine (an antioxidant; 1-100 \u00b5M) for 24h, followed by a 24-h withdrawal period. Ketamine exposure resulted in elevated NMDA receptor (NR1) expression, increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as indicated by higher levels of 8-oxoguanine production, and enhanced neuronal damage. Coadministration of L-carnitine significantly diminished ROS generation and provided near complete protection of neurons from ketamine-induced cell death. NMDA receptors regulate channels that are highly permeable to calcium, and calcium imaging data demonstrated that neurons exposed to ketamine had a significantly elevated amplitude of calcium influx and higher intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i) evoked by NMDA (50 \u00b5M), compared with control neurons. These findings suggest that prolonged ketamine exposure produces an increase in NMDA receptor expression (compensatory upregulation), which allows for a higher/toxic influx of calcium into neurons once ketamine is removed from the system, leading to elevated ROS generation and neuronal cell death.

Use of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer upon retinol interaction with RALDHs provides evidence that retinal recognition occurs in two steps: binding into the substrate access channel, and a slower structural reorganization with a rate constant of the same magnitude as the kcat for retinal oxidation: 0.18 vs. 0.07 and 0.25 vs. 0.1 s(-1) for ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A2, respectively. This suggests that the conformational transition of the RALDH-retinal complex significantly contributes to the rate-limiting step that controls the kinetics of retinal oxidation, as a prerequisite for the formation of a catalytically competent Michaelis complex. This conclusion is consistent with the general notion that structural flexibility within the active site of ALDH enzymes has been shown to be an integral component of catalysis.", "anno": [[113, 114, true], [225, 226, true], [416, 417, true], [568, 569, true], [809, 810, true], [957, 958, true], [1344, 1345, true], [1607, 1608, true], [1785, 1786, true]]}, {"id": 23161651, "text": "The reversible change of the phosphorylation state of proteins regulates key cellular processes. In the present study, three different gel-based approaches were compared with regard to their applicability to quantitatively analyse the phosphoproteome of scarce biological material obtained ex vivo.

Using this approach, 30 \u03bcg of enriched phosphoproteins proved to be sufficient for the phosphoproteome characterisation. In contrast, sequential fluorescence staining of 2D-separated total cell lysates as well as sequential staining in conjunction with a pre-enrichment step led to detection discrepancies and excluded further analysis steps.

Predicting combination effects based on concentration-response analysis of individual components is a valid strategy for accurate toxicological assessment of mixtures. We previously reported that joint effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) and three other often co-ingested amphetamines (methamphetamine, 4-methylthyoamphetamine and D-amphetamine) could be predicted by the concentration addition (CA) model in HepG2 cells. We sought to further evaluate the relevance of these findings by extending these studies to a cell model that more closely mimics the in vivo situation. Detailed cytotoxic information of the four individual amphetamines on primary rat hepatocytes was recorded by the MTT assay, at 37\u00b0C and 40.5\u00b0C, simulating the rise in body temperature that could be induced following amphetamine intake. Mixture expectations were calculated using CA and independent action (IA) models. At 37\u00b0C, concentration-dependent cytotoxicity occurred for the drugs individually and combined. Mixture effects were accurately predicted by the CA model, while the IA model underestimated cytotoxicity. At 40.5\u00b0C these cytotoxic effects were aggravated.

The answer to the long debated question of what makes a 'healthy' ASM cell become 'asthmatic' still remains speculative. What is known of an 'asthmatic' ASM cell, is its ability to contribute to the hallmarks of asthma such as bronchoconstriction (contractile phenotype), inflammation (synthetic phenotype) and ASM hyperplasia (proliferative phenotype). The phenotype of healthy or diseased ASM cells or tissue for the most part is determined by expression of key phenotypic markers. ASM is commonly accepted to have different phenotypes: the contractile (differentiated) state versus the synthetic (dedifferentiated) state (with the capacity to synthesize mediators, proliferate and migrate). There is now accumulating evidence that the synthetic functions of ASM in culture derived from asthmatic and non-asthmatic donors differ.
