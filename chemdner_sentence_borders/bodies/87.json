The mechanism by which lncRNAs affect chromatin structure and mRNA production remains mostly unknown. Here we identify the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodeling complex as a component of the RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing pathway. We found that SWI3B, an essential subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, physically interacts with a lncRNA-binding protein, IDN2. SWI/SNF subunits contribute to lncRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing. Moreover, Pol V mediates stabilization of nucleosomes on silenced regions. We propose that Pol V-produced lncRNAs mediate transcriptional silencing by guiding the SWI/SNF complex and establishing positioned nucleosomes on specific genomic loci.

Only mice lacking the \u03b12 subunit showed reduction of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) to ethanol. These results are in agreement with data from knock-in mice with mutation of the ethanol-sensitive site in the \u03b12-subunit (Blednov et\u00a0al., 2011). All together, they indicate that aversive property of ethanol is dependent on ethanol action on \u03b12-containing GABA(A)-R. Deletion of the \u03b12-subunit led to faster recovery whereas absence of the \u03b13-subunit slowed recovery from ethanol-induced incoordination (rotarod).

Because sulfated neurosteroids also modulate NMDARs, here we examined the effects of DPA on NMDAR function. In rat hippocampal neurons DPA inhibited currents gated by 300 \u00b5M NMDA with an IC(50) of 2.3 \u00b5M. Neither onset nor offset of antagonism exhibited dependence on channel activation but exhibited a noncompetitive profile. DPA antagonism was independent of NMDAR subunit composition and was similar at extrasynaptic and total receptor populations. Surprisingly, similar to cationic channel blockers but unlike sulfated neurosteroids, DPA antagonism was voltage dependent. Onset and offset of DPA antagonism were nearly 10-fold faster than DPA-induced increases in membrane capacitance, suggesting that membrane interactions do not directly explain antagonism. Furthermore, voltage dependence did not derive from association of DPA with a site on NMDARs directly accessible to the outer membrane leaflet, assessed by DPA translocation experiments. Consistent with the expected lack of channel block, DPA antagonism did not interact with permeant ions. Therefore, we speculate that voltage dependence may arise from interactions of DPA with the inherent voltage dependence of channel gating.

Initial NMR studies showed that 6DBF7 binds to gal-1 on one side of the \u03b2-sandwich away from the lectin's carbohydrate binding site. Although an alanine scan of 6DBF7 showed that the two cationic groups (lysines) in the partial peptide are crucial to its angiostatic activity, it is the hydrophobic face of the amphipath that appears to interact directly with the surface of gal-1. Based on this structural information, we designed and tested additional DBF analogs. In particular, substitution of the C-terminal Asp for alanine and branched alkyl side chains (Val, Leu, Ile) for linear ones (Nle, Nva) rendered the greatest improvements in activity. Flow cytometry with gal-1(-/-) splenocytes showed that 6DBF7 and two of its more potent analogs (DB16 and DB21) can fully inhibit fluorescein isothiocyanate-gal-1 binding.

RESULTS: Our results show that venlafaxine induced an increase in sensitivity of 5-HT1B receptors in hypothalamus both at G-protein level and the control of core temperature without affecting the receptor density. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that adaptive changes on 5-HT1B receptors induced by chronic administration of venlafaxine exhibit regional differences suggesting that the hypothalamus might be an important site of drug action.", "anno": [[9, 10, true], [248, 249, true], [423, 424, true], [602, 603, true], [747, 748, true], [759, 760, true], [952, 953, true], [961, 962, true], [1179, 1180, true], [1188, 1189, true], [1393, 1394, true], [1406, 1407, true], [1628, 1629, true]]}, {"id": 23467004, "text": "The use of molecular markers in taxonomic studies has become a standard practice in biology.

This study examined species boundaries in the red algal genus Chiharaea. We used five molecular markers, with at least one marker from each genome, coupled with thorough morphological analyses.

We suggest that this discordance is indicative of ongoing hybridization and introgression between populations of C. americana f. americana and C. americana f. bodegensis.

It is observed that as the separation gap between AuHCs nanoparticles decreases, their localized surface plasmon resonance band red shifts more than AuHSs. This is accounted for by the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) calculations. The coupling between the plasmon fields of the AuHCs pair is stronger than that between AuHSs pair. Using the DDA calculation, this is found to be due to geometric factors, as well as to the difference in the plasmonic field intensity.

The trials used were appropriate, although no definitive judgement regarding the comparative efficacy of golimumab with other biologics was possible. The manufacturer provided a DMARD-experienced population model and a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor-experienced population model. The models allowed sequences of treatments to be evaluated for each population, although a fully incremental analysis between the use of golimumab following DMARD failure and the use of golimumab following TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor failure was not possible. Several limitations with the model were identified, and after a request from NICE and suspension of the appraisal, the manufacturer submitted sensitivity analyses with an additional American College of Rheumatology 70\u00a0% improvement criteria (ACR70) health state included, using SF-36 data directly from the GO-FORWARD study. The annual rate of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score increase for patients receiving palliative treatment was also changed from 0.09 to 0.06. The further analyses provided highlighted the particular sensitivity of the results to HAQ progression rates and the re-administration frequency for rituximab in the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor-experienced population.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of DP treatment on the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) in long-term ethanol-experienced rats as a model of relapse behavior and measure drug plasma and brain levels during treatment. METHODS: Rats were subcutaneously implanted with mini-osmotic pumps delivering 0, 0.25, or 1\u00a0mg/h of DP during 1 week. The efficacy to prevent ADE was determined. DP plasma and brain levels achieved during its subcutaneous administration were measured.

RESULTS: One milligram per hour, but not 0.25\u00a0mg/h, DP infusion prevented ADE and reduced the total ethanol preference in animals.

Methods: PSM was prepared by the W/O emulsion - freeze thawing method. The porous structure of PSM was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis. The adsorption role of nanopores on the drug dissolution and physical state of LV was systematically studied by instrumental analysis, and in vitro and in vivo drug dissolution studies. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to evaluate carrier cytotoxicity. Results: The SEM images of PSM showed nanometer-sized pores. Physical state characterization indicated that porous structure effectively limited the degree of crystallinity of LV. The results of in vitro and in vivo tests testified that PSM accelerated the release of LV and enhanced its oral bioavailability in comparison with crude LV and commercial capsules.

In this cascade, an early acting GEF (GBF1) activates ARFs that mediate recruitment of late acting GEFs (BIG1/2) to coordinate coating events within the pre-Golgi/Golgi/TGN continuum.

Elevated expression of FGF23 may therefore play a crucial role in defining immune responses to vitamin D and this, in turn, may be a key determinant of infection in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).", "anno": [[189, 190, true], [378, 379, true], [510, 511, true], [828, 829, true], [992, 993, true], [1165, 1166, true], [1240, 1241, true], [1441, 1442, true], [1576, 1577, true], [1746, 1747, true], [1955, 1956, true]]}, {"id": 23460363, "text": "In spite of their attractive features, widespread biomedical applications of CS nanoparticles are yet to be realized due to their poor stability in physiological conditions, such as in buffer system at pH 7.4.

Our results showed that cinobufagin potently inhibited the proliferation of U2OS, MG63 and SaOS-2 cells. Significant increases in G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in OS cells were also observed. The expression levels of several apoptotic proteins were assessed after cinobufagin treatment in U2OS cells.

Furthermore, we validated the inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling following cinobufagin treatment. Western blots showed a decrease in nuclear p65 protein expression after exposure to different concentrations of cinobufagin, while the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 was simultaneously increased. Transduction with constitutively active forms of GSK-3\u03b2 could protect against the downregulation of p65 and upregulation of cleaved-PARP that are induced by cinobufagin treatment.

While RT-PCR can provide quantitative data on gene expression, it lacks spatial sensitivity to examine localized gene expression; and, isolation of organs from zebrafish embryos is technically difficult, if not impossible.

The intensities of IR features of 1-C(10)H(9)(+) decreased after the matrix was maintained in darkness for 19 h, whereas those of 1-C(10)H(9) and 2-C(10)H(9) increased. Irradiation of this matrix sample with light at 365 nm diminished lines of 1-C(10)H(9)(+) and 2-C(10)H(9) and enhanced lines of 1-C(10)H(9) and 2-C(10)H(9)(+); the latter species was unstable and converted to 1-C(10)H(9)(+) in less than 30 min and 2-C(10)H(9) was converted to 1-C(10)H(9) at 365 nm. Observed wavenumbers and relative intensities of these species agree satisfactorily with the anharmonic vibrational wavenumbers and IR intensities predicted with the B3PW91/6-311++G(2d,2p) method. Compared with spectra recorded previously with IR photodissociation of Ar-tagged C(10)H(9)(+) or IR multiphoton dissociation of C(10)H(9)(+), our method has the advantages of producing high-resolution IR spectra with a wide spectral coverage, true IR intensity and excellent ratio of signal to noise; both protonated species and their neutral counterparts are produced with little interference from other fragments. With these advantages, the IR spectra of 1-C(10)H(9)(+), 2-C(10)H(9)(+), 1-C(10)H(9), and 2-C(10)H(9) are here clearly characterized.", "anno": [[255, 256, true], [411, 412, true], [542, 543, true], [711, 712, true], [1011, 1012, true], [1208, 1209, true], [1624, 1625, true], [1758, 1759, true]]}, {"id": 23342998, "text": "HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) undergoes a series of conformational changes during viral replication and is a central target for antiretroviral therapy.

A total of 775 fragments were grouped into 143 cocktails, which were soaked into crystals of RT in complex with the non-nucleoside drug rilpivirine (TMC278). Seven new sites were discovered, including the Incoming Nucleotide Binding, Knuckles, NNRTI Adjacent, and 399 sites, located in the polymerase region of RT, and the 428, RNase H Primer Grip Adjacent, and 507 sites, located in the RNase H region.

We present for the first time the metabolism, degradation, and disposition of linaclotide in animals and humans. We examined the metabolic stability of linaclotide in conditions that mimic the gastrointestinal tract and characterized the metabolite MM-419447 (CCEYCCNPACTGC), which contributes to the pharmacologic effects of linaclotide. Systemic exposure to these active peptides is low in rats and humans, and the low systemic and portal vein concentrations of linaclotide and MM-419447 observed in the rat confirmed both peptides are minimally absorbed after oral administration. Linaclotide is stable in the acidic environment of the stomach and is converted to MM-419447 in the small intestine. The disulfide bonds of both peptides are reduced in the small intestine, where they are subsequently proteolyzed and degraded. After oral administration of linaclotide, <1% of the dose was excreted as active peptide in rat feces and a mean of 3-5% in human feces; in both cases MM-419447 was the predominant peptide recovered. MM-419447 exhibits high-affinity binding in vitro to T84 cells, resulting in a significant, concentration-dependent accumulation of intracellular cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). In rat models of gastrointestinal function, orally dosed MM-419447 significantly increased fluid secretion into small intestinal loops, increased intraluminal cGMP, and caused a dose-dependent acceleration in gastrointestinal transit. These results demonstrate the importance of the active metabolite in contributing to linaclotide's pharmacology.", "anno": [[205, 206, true], [318, 319, true], [544, 545, true], [789, 790, true], [906, 907, true], [1033, 1034, true], [1233, 1234, true], [1424, 1425, true], [1659, 1660, true], [1772, 1773, true]]}]}
