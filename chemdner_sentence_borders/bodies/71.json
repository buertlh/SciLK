However, decades of development have documented only scant opportunities in bioconjugation with PVA. As such, materials derived thereof fail to answer the call for functional biomaterials for advanced cell culture and tissue engineering applications. To address these limitations, PVA is synthesized with terminal thiol groups and conjugated with thiolated peptides using PVA in solution. Further, microstructured, surface-adhered PVA physical hydrogels are assembled, the available conjugation sites within the hydrogels are quantified, and quantitative kinetic data are collected on peptide conjugation to the hydrogels. The success of bioconjugation in the gel phase is quantified through the use of a cell-adhesive peptide and visualization of cell adhesion on PVA hydrogels as cell culture substrates. Taken together, the presented data establish a novel paradigm in bioconjugation and functionalization of PVA physical hydrogels. Coupled with an excellent safety profile of PVA, these results deliver a superior biomaterial for diverse biomedical applications.", "anno": [[241, 242, true], [387, 388, true], [488, 489, true], [638, 639, true], [776, 777, true], [1010, 1011, true], [1194, 1195, true], [1323, 1324, true], [1454, 1455, true]]}, {"id": 23323548, "text": "Abstract 1. Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are a family of transporter proteins that have been extensively recognized as key determinants of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of various drugs. Human OATP1A2 has been demonstrated to transport wide spectrum of endogenous and exogenous compounds. Study on OATP1A2 orthologues of other species, however, is still limited. 2. Here, we described the cloning and functional characterization of a member of the OATP/Oatp family member obtained from pig (Sus scrofa) liver. Sequence analysis suggested that it has a high homology with human OATP1A2 and bovine Oatp1a2. Prototypic substrates estrone-3-sulfate (E-3-S) and taurocholic acid were transported by the protein. The transport of these two substrates is pH-dependent, with lower pH showing higher uptake function. Kinetic study showed the transport of these two substrates have a K(m) of 42.5\u2009\u00b1\u200912.1 and 33.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7\u2009\u00b5M, respectively.

The adsorbed layer of octadecanol included a small amount of a lipophilic fluorophore-octadecanol modified with BODIPY-to enable fluorescence imaging. The deposited octadecanol layer was found not to allow liposomes to interact unless the potential was less than -0.4 V/SCE, which introduces defects into the adsorbed layer. Small increases in the capacitance of the adsorbed layer were measured after introducing the defects, allowing the liposomes to interact with the defects and then annealing the defects at 0 V/SCE. A change in the adsorbed layer was also signified by a more positive desorption potential for the liposome-modified adsorbed layer as compared to that for an adsorbed layer that was porated in a similar fashion but without liposomes present in the electrolyte. These subtle changes in capacitance are difficult to interpret, so an in situ spectroscopic study was performed to provide a more direct measure of the interaction. The incorporation of liposomes should result in an increase in the fluorescence measured because the fluorophore should become further separated from the gold surface, reducing the efficiency of fluorescence quenching. No significant increase in the fluorescence of the adsorbed layer was observed during the potential pulses used in the poration procedure in the absence of liposomes. In the presence of liposomes, the fluorescence intensity was found to depend on the potential and time used for poration. At 0 V/SCE, no significant change in the fluorescence was observed for defect-free adsorbed layers. Changing the poration potential to -0.4 V/SCE caused significant increases in the fluorescence and the appearance of new structural features in the adsorbed layers that were more easily observed during the desorption procedure.

Mice were subjected to cyclic mechanical loading at the sixth caudal vertebra with 8N or 0N (control) three times per week for a total period of 14weeks.

Mechanical parameters were derived from micro-finite element analysis. Dynamic bone morphometry was calculated using registration of serial micro-CT scans. Bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness increased significantly more for the loaded group than for the control group (p=0.006 and p=0.002 respectively). The trabecular bone microstructure adapted to the load of 8N in approximately ten weeks, indicated by the trabecular bone volume fraction, which increased from 16.7% at 0weeks to 21.6% at week 10 and only showed little change afterwards (bone volume fraction of 21.5% at 14weeks). Similarly bone stiffness - at the start of the experiment 649N/mm - reached 846N/mm at 10weeks in the loaded group and was maintained to the end of the experiment (850N/mm). At 4weeks the bone formation rate was 32% greater and the bone resorption rate 22% less for 8N compared to 0N. This difference was significantly reduced as the bone adapted to 8N, with 8N remodeling rates returning to the values of the 0N group at approximately 10weeks. Together these data suggest that once bone has adapted to a new loading state, the remodeling rates reduce gradually while maintaining bone volume fraction and stiffness.", "anno": [[60, 61, true], [183, 184, true], [351, 352, true], [505, 506, true], [650, 651, true], [721, 722, true], [806, 807, true], [965, 966, true], [1246, 1247, true], [1420, 1421, true], [1531, 1532, true], [1691, 1692, true], [1862, 1863, true]]}, {"id": 23430161, "text": "RATIONALE: Prior research has found that adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show increased sensitivity to the impairing effects of alcohol (Weafer et al., Exp Clin Psychopharmacol 17: 113-121, 2009). However, these studies have focused exclusively on the ascending limb of the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) curve, and it is unclear whether these adults continue to show increased sensitivity during the later phase of the dose as BAC is declining. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the hypothesis that those with ADHD would display increased response to alcohol during the ascending limb of the BAC curve and less recovery from the impairing effects during the descending limb. METHODS: Adult social drinkers with ADHD and control adults completed measures of motor coordination, reaction time (RT), and subjective intoxication twice following 0.64\u00a0g/kg alcohol and placebo. The measures were administered during the ascending limb of the BAC curve and again during the descending limb. RESULTS: During the ascending limb, alcohol reduced motor coordination, slowed RT, and increased self-reports of subjective intoxication. Those with ADHD displayed greater impairment of motor coordination compared with controls. During the descending limb, controls reported diminished subjective intoxication and showed recovery from the impairing effects of alcohol on both their motor coordination and their RT. Those with ADHD showed reduced subjective intoxication and faster RT during this time, but they did not recover motor control.

It has been estimated that microbial species comprise about 60% of the Earth's biomass. This, together with the fact that their genetic, metabolic and physiological diversity is extraordinary, makes them a major threat to the health and development of populations across the world. Widespread antibiotic resistance, the emergence of new pathogens in addition to the resurgence of old ones, and the lack of effective new therapeutics exacerbate the problems. Thus, the need to discover and develop new antimicrobial agents is critical to improve mankind's future health. Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) offer particular promise in this sense. Plant Kingdom could be considered a rich source of the most diverse structures (e.g. there are more than 12,000 known alkaloids, more than 8,000 phenolic compounds and over 25,000 different terpenoids), many of which were proven to possess strong antimicrobial properties (e.g. thymol, eurabienol, etc.). In many instances, PSMs can be easily isolated from the plant matrix, either in pure state or in the form of mixtures of chemically related compounds. What is also important is that the development of bacterial resistance toward natural plant products (that are generally regarded as eco-friendly) has been thus far documented in a very limited number of cases (e.g. for reserpine). Having all of the mentioned advantages of PSMs as potential antimicrobials in mind, a major question arises: why is it that there are still no commercially available or commonly used antibiotics of plant origin? This review tries to give a critical answer to this question by considering potential mechanisms of antimicrobial action of PSMs (inhibition of cell wall or protein synthesis, inducing leakage from the cells by tampering with the function of the membranes, interfering with intermediary metabolisms or DNA/RNA synthesis/function), as well as their physical and chemical properties (e.g. hydrophilicity/lipophilicity, chemical stability). To address the possible synergistic/antagonistic effects between PSMs and with standard antibiotics, special attention has been given to the antimicrobial activity of PSM-mixtures (e.g. essential oils, plant extracts). Moreover, possible ways of overcoming some of PSMs molecular limitations in respect to their usage as potential antibiotics were also discussed (e.g. derivatization that would enable fine tuning of certain molecular characteristics).", "anno": [[97, 98, true], [185, 186, true], [379, 380, true], [555, 556, true], [667, 668, true], [742, 743, true], [1047, 1048, true], [1198, 1199, true], [1430, 1431, true], [2080, 2081, true], [2299, 2300, true], [2533, 2534, true]]}, {"id": 23561153, "text": "Cell wall material from potato pulp by-product was used for the extraction of galactan-rich rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) type pectic polysaccharides using alkaline (NaOH and KOH) and enzymatic (endopolygalacturonase from Aspergillus niger) methods.

We performed femoral fractures with internal fixation in transgenic mice that overexpress EphB4 under the collagen type 1 promoter (Col1-EphB4) and investigated the bone repair process up to 12 weeks postfracture. The data indicated that Col1-EphB4 mice exhibited stiffer and stronger bones after fracture compared with wild-type mice. The fractured bones of Col1-EphB4 transgenic mice displayed significantly greater tissue and bone volume 2 weeks postfracture compared with that of wild-type mice. These findings correlated with increased chondrogenesis and mineral formation within the callus site at 2 weeks postfracture, as demonstrated by increased safranin O and von Kossa staining, respectively. Interestingly, Col1-EphB4 mice were found to possess significantly greater numbers of clonogenic mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells (CFU-F), with an increased capacity to form mineralized nodules in vitro under osteogenic conditions, when compared with those of the wild-type control mice. Furthermore, Col1-EphB4 mice had significantly lower numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts within the callus site.

RESULTS: In contrast to immune stimulatory sequence ISS 1018, BCG DNA spontaneously formed nanoparticulate structures and induced actin polymerization as did synthetic silica nanoparticles. Co-incubation with silica nanoparticles amplified the responsiveness of macrophages toward the TLR9 ligand ISS 1018.

Sciadopitysin caused a significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen synthesis, osteocalcin production, mineralization, and glutathione content in the cells (P<0.05). Sciadopitysin also decreased the production of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-\u03b1) induced by antimycin A, a mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor. We investigated the protective effects of sciadopitysin on antimycin A-induced toxicity in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Exposure of MC3T3-E1 cells to antimycin A caused a significant reduction in osteoblast dysfunction. However, pretreatment with sciadopitysin prior to antimycin A exposure significantly reduced antimycin A-induced cell damage by preventing mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) loss, reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, and nitrotyrosine increase, suggesting that sciadopitysin may be useful for protecting mitochondria against a burst of oxidative stress.

CNA goes beyond the mere identification of flexible and rigid regions in a biomacromolecule in that it (I) provides a refined modeling of thermal unfolding simulations that also considers the temperature-dependence of hydrophobic tethers, (II) allows performing rigidity analyses on ensembles of network topologies, either generated from structural ensembles or by using the concept of fuzzy noncovalent constraints, and (III) computes a set of global and local indices for quantifying biomacromolecular stability. This leads to more robust results from rigidity analyses and extends the application domain of rigidity analyses in that phase transition points (\"melting points\") and unfolding nuclei (\"structural weak spots\") are determined automatically. Furthermore, CNA robustly handles small-molecule ligands in general. Such advancements are important for applying rigidity analysis to data-driven protein engineering and for estimating the influence of ligand molecules on biomacromolecular stability. CNA maintains the efficiency of FIRST such that the analysis of a single protein structure takes a few seconds for systems of several hundred residues on a single core.

Passive stiffness, on the other hand, is thought to stem from non-muscle component of the airway wall, especially the collagen/elastin fibrous network of the extracellular matrix within which the muscle cells are embedded. In this brief review, the notion that passive stiffness is exclusively extracellular in origin is challenged.

In the Drosophila brain, PICK1 and ICA69 co-immunoprecipitated and showed mutually dependent expression. Finally, both in a Drosophila model of type 2 diabetes and in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice, we observed up-regulation of PICK1 mRNA expression. Our findings suggest that PICK1, together with ICA69, is critical during budding of immature secretory vesicles from the TGN and thus for vesicular storage of GH and possibly other hormones.

During this period, herbalists were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires investigating the herbalist as a holder of information (gender, age and educational level) and about wild medicinal plants (local name, uses and part used). In addition, the relative importance value of the species was determined and informant consensus factor (ICF) was calculated for the medicinal plants included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 83 herbalists were interviewed, men dominate the practice of traditional medicine in the region. About 41% of them are between 31-40 years, and about a third (34%) is illiterate. The traditional herbal knowledge is passed from generation to generation in the verbal form, being almost totally absent a writing tradition. The interviewed herbalists identified and recorded 58 plants species and 50 genera belonging to 27 plant families. Lamiaceae and Asteraceae were the most represented plant families. The aerial parts were the most commonly used plant part, while infusion and decoction were the most common method of traditional drug preparation.

Moreover, cocaine and other drugs of abuse can affect the strength of glutamate synapses in this structure, lastly modifying neuronal activity in main regions of the reward circuitry.

The rats were randomly distributed into 4 experimental groups: the vehicle-sedentary group, the ND-sedentary group, the vehicle-exercise group, and the ND-exercise group.

After the 15-day period, the rats were trained and tested on a water maze spatial task using four trials per day for 5 consecutive days followed by a probe trial two days later. Exercise significantly improved performance during both the training and retention of the water maze task, and enhanced hippocampal BDNF.

Drugs with high market revenues trigger fierce competition between pharmaceutical enterprises, as is demonstrated by the increasing Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) cases focusing on seizing the best-selling products. On the other hand, patents, as the best shield for innovative drugs against generic drugs, become a powerful weapon for pharmaceutical enterprises to win the substantial returns generated by market exclusivity. Patents seem to be directly responsible for the commercial success of new medicines.

Solutions of 0.2-0.3 mM CoSO(4) at pH 6.0 and 10.6 (air-saturated and Ar-purged) were irradiated at an absorbed dose rate of 5.5 kGy h(-1). The resulting concentrations of H(2), H(2)O(2), Co(II) and Co(III) species in solution and the chemical composition and sizes of particles that were formed were measured as a function of irradiation time. Particle formation was observed only for initially air-saturated CoSO(4) solutions at pH 10.6. Analysis of the particle formation as a function of irradiation time shows that the particles evolve from Co(OH)(2) to CoOOH and then to Co(3)O(4). The radiolytic oxidation of Co(II) to Co(III) was completed in 100 min and the chemical composition of the final particles was identified as Co(3)O(4) by XPS, Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show the final particles are approximately uniform in size, ranging from 8 to 20 nm. A mechanism is proposed to explain the particle formation. A key factor is the low solubility of Co(OH)(2) in air-saturated solutions at high pH. This mechanism for particle formation is compared with the mechanism previously reported for the radiolytic formation of \u03b3-FeOOH nanoparticles.", "anno": [[114, 115, true], [254, 255, true], [459, 460, true], [554, 555, true], [702, 703, true], [892, 893, true], [1023, 1024, true], [1082, 1083, true], [1169, 1170, true], [1313, 1314, true]]}, {"id": 23471741, "text": "Ritonavir is commonly used as a pharmacokinetic booster for antiretroviral regimens in the management of human immunodeficiency virus infections.

Herein, curvilinear surface relief microstructures in PDMS are fabricated through a simple three-stage approach combining microcontact printing (\u03bcCP), selective surface wetting/dewetting and replica molding (REM). First, using an original PDMS stamp (first-generation stamp) with linear relief features, a chemical pattern on gold substrate is generated by \u03bcCP using hexadecanethiol (HDT) as an ink. Then, by a dip-coating process, an ordered polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer-dot array forms on the HDT-patterned gold substrate. Finally, based on a REM process, the PEG-dot array on gold substrate is used to fabricate a second-generation PDMS stamp with microcavity array, and the second-generation PDMS stamp is used to generate third-generation PDMS stamp with microbump array. These fabricated new-generation stamps are utilized in \u03bcCP and in micromolding in capillaries (MIMIC), allowing the generation of surface micropatterns which cannot be obtained using the original PDMS stamp.

Central to pathogenesis, Th2 and Th17 lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system control many aspects of the disease by producing cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17. In addition, many cells of the innate immune system such as mast cells, basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells (DCs), and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play an important role in the initiation or maintenance of disease. Epithelial cells are ever more implicated in disease pathogenesis, as they are able to sense exposure to pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and can activate DCs. This review article will deal with the role of cytokines that are considered essential controllers of the inflammatory, immune and regenerative response to allergens, viruses and environmental pollutants. Emerging Th2 cytokines such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin, GM-CSF, IL-1, IL-33, IL-25 mediate the crosstalk between epithelial cells, DCs, and ILCs. Understanding the crosstalk between structural cells, innate and adaptive immune cells that is mediated by cytokines provides important mechanistic insights into how asthma develops and perpetuates itself.

CPEB regulates protein expression by inhibiting polyadenylation of selected mRNA transcripts, which prevents binding of the ribosome for protein synthesis. Two RNA recognition motif domains and a C-terminal binuclear zinc-binding domain are required for mRNA binding, but the zinc-binding domain is not required for sequence-specific recognition of the targeted mRNA transcript. The structure and function of the zinc-binding domain of CPEB are unknown. The C-terminal region of CPEB may participate in assembly of the ribonucleoprotein complex that includes the scaffold protein, Symplekin, and the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor. Sumoylation of Symplekin is required for polyadenylation, and both cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor and poly(A) polymerase are sumoylated. The foreshortened poly(A) tail is maintained by poly(A) ribonuclease, which associates with CPEB. While zinc-binding domains are renowned for nucleic acid recognition, binuclear zinc-binding structural motifs, such as LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, Mec-3), RING (really interesting new gene), PHD (plant homeodomain) and ZZ (ZZ-type zinc finger) domains, participate in protein-protein interactions. Here, we report the solution structure of the C-terminal zinc-binding domain of CPEB1 (CPEB1-ZZ), which has a cross-braced zinc binding topology. The structural similarity to other ZZ domains suggests that the CPEB1-ZZ domain recruits sumoylated proteins during assembly of the ribonucleoprotein complex prior to mRNA export from the nucleus.", "anno": [[181, 182, true], [337, 338, true], [560, 561, true], [635, 636, true], [830, 831, true], [984, 985, true], [1082, 1083, true], [1373, 1374, true], [1519, 1520, true], [1716, 1717, true]]}]}
