Recent studies demonstrated the role of rictor in the development and function of \u03b2-cells. mTORC1 has long been known to impact \u03b2-cell function and development. However, most of the studies evaluating its role used either drug treatment (i.e. rapamycin) or modification of expression of proteins known to modulate its activity, and the direct role of raptor in insulin secretion is unclear. In this study, using siRNA, we investigated the role of raptor and rictor in insulin secretion and production in INS-1 cells and the possible cross talk between their respective complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Reduced expression of raptor is associated with increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and intracellular insulin content. Downregulation of rictor expression leads to impaired insulin secretion without affecting insulin content and is able to correct the increased insulin secretion mediated by raptor siRNA. Using dominant-negative or constitutively active forms of Akt, we demonstrate that the effect of both raptor and rictor is mediated through alteration of Akt signaling. Our finding shed new light on the mechanism of control of insulin secretion and production by the mTOR, and they provide evidence for antagonistic effect of raptor and rictor on insulin secretion in response to glucose by modulating the activity of Akt, whereas only raptor is able to control insulin biosynthesis.", "anno": [[191, 192, true], [282, 283, true], [352, 353, true], [582, 583, true], [790, 791, true], [920, 921, true], [1107, 1108, true], [1276, 1277, true], [1591, 1592, true]]}, {"id": 23411251, "text": "Staghorn sumac (Rhus hirta L.) is a native tree in Eastern Canada whose fruit has been used by aboriginal peoples to treat various illnesses, and has recently been found to be a good source of antioxidants.

Mixed populations of different cell types were isolated from adult long bones of C57BL/6J mice by enzymatic digestion, and subsequently subjected to FACS to purify and characterize osteoblast lineage cells via a selection strategy using antibodies against CD31, CD45, and alkaline phosphatase (AP), specific for mature osteoblasts. The purified individual osteoblast lineage cells were then profiled at the single cell level via nanofluidic PCR. This method permits robust gene expression profiling on single osteoblast lineage cells derived from mature bone, potentially from anatomically distinct sites. In conjunction with this technique, we have also shown that it is possible to carry out single cell profiling on cells purified from fixed and frozen bone samples without compromising the gene expression signal. The latter finding means the technique can be extended to biopsies of bone from diseased individuals.

Treatment with adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx), an inhibitor of transmethylation-suppressive adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase (SAHH), enhanced the level of SAH and effectively blocked the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells; the treatment also induced the differentiation of C6 glioma cells and suppressed the neovascular genesis of eggs in a dose-dependent manner.

Because BPH and prostate cancer (PCa) share some common pathological characteristics, we investigated whether susceptibility loci for PCa contributed to BPH risk and BPH aggressiveness in Chinese men. METHODS: Fourteen SNPs associated with PCa risk in a Chinese population were genotyped in 426 BPH cases (184 aggressive and 242 non-aggressive BPH cases) and 1,008 controls. The association between the SNPs and BPH risk/aggressiveness was estimated using logistic regression analysis. In addition, effects of the 14 SNPs on BPH related clinical traits, including International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate volume, total PSA, and free PSA were evaluated using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Two SNPs, rs12621278 in ITGA6 at 2q31 (OR\u2009=\u20090.82, P\u2009=\u20090.05) and rs339331 in RFX6 at 6q22 (OR\u2009=\u20091.22, P\u2009=\u20090.04) were significantly associated with BPH. In addition, rs12621278 (OR\u2009=\u20090.73, P\u2009=\u20090.05) and rs12653946, 13\u2009kb upstream of IRX4 at 5p15 (OR\u2009=\u20091.40, 0.03), were significantly associated with aggressive BPH. Moreover, the risk allele of rs12621278 (G) and rs12653946 (T) for aggressive BPH were significantly associated with elevated IPSS after treatment (P\u2009=\u20090.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic investigation on the contributions of PCa susceptibility loci to risk and aggressiveness of BPH. Our findings advance our understanding of the genetic basis of BPH, especially aggressive BPH. In addition, our results provide new insights into the genetic determinants shared between BPH and PCa.

This paradigm, with delayed administration of oxime to a time when brain AChE was starting to recover, was designed to minimize reactivation/reinhibition of peripheral AChE during the reactivation period which would decrease the availability of the surrogate for entry into the brain; this paradigm will allow proof of concept of BBB penetrability. The initial studies of these oximes in vivo with the sarin surrogate NIMP have indicated reactivation of up to about 25% at 30min after oxime administration and substantial attenuation of seizure behavior from some of the oximes.

Studies were included if provided (1) a finite list of anticholinergic drugs; (2) a grading score of anticholinergic potency and, (3) a validation in a clinical or experimental setting. We listed anticholinergic drugs for which there was agreement in the different scales. In case of discrepancies between scores we used a reputed reference source (Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference\u00ae) to take a final decision about the anticholinergic activity of the drug. RESULTS: We included seven risk scales, and evaluated 225 different drugs.

PFOA and PFOS effects differed with DHEA and estrone. While PFOS decreased DHEA levels, PFOA produced an increase at day 49, and while PFOS decreased estrone, PFOA produced a slight increase at day 56. We observed changes in FA composition that predominantly involved increases in FA methyl esters (FAMEs), mono- and poly-unsaturated FA (MUFA and PUFA) and a decrease in n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio by both PFOA and PFOS. Particularly, an increase in - pentadecenoic MUFA (15:1), two n-3 PUFAs \u03b1-linolenic acid [ALA: 18:3 n3] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA: 20:5 n-3] and n-6 PUFA: arachidonic acid [ARA: 20:4 n6], docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) by PFOA and PFOS were observed. These effects were associated with changes in mRNA expression of FA elongase (FAE), \u03945-desaturase (FAD5) and \u03946-desaturase (FAD6) genes. In summary, the changes in hormonal and FA profiles may represent cellular and/or physiological adaptation to continuous PFOS and PFOA exposure by increasing membrane fluidity, and/or overt developmental effects. The present findings provide some potential insights and basis for a better understanding on the possible mechanisms of PFCs toxicity in fish.", "anno": [[184, 185, true], [306, 307, true], [395, 396, true], [496, 497, true], [712, 713, true], [867, 868, true], [1009, 1010, true], [1242, 1243, true], [1296, 1297, true], [1444, 1445, true], [1655, 1656, true], [1908, 1909, true], [2045, 2046, true], [2258, 2259, true], [2401, 2402, true]]}, {"id": 23414805, "text": "Irreversible modification is one of the most promising strategies to identify cellular receptors of bioactive small molecules. Here we report that receptor proteins can be chemically tagged using a 5-sulfonyl tetrazole probe. 5-Sulfonyl tetrazole easily accepted nucleophilic attack of thiol groups, while 5-sulfinyl tetrazole did not. These functional groups were introduced into probe molecules of a natural product. Cyclosporine A, an immunosuppressant produced by a microbe, was derivatized to possess 5-sulfonyl tetrazole and a tag group, which enabled chemical tagging of cyclophilin A, the cellular receptor of cyclosporine A. Cyclosporine A derivative possessing 5-sulfinyl tetrazole could not tag cyclophilin A.

Here we report that Rif1(-/-) mice are severely compromised for 53BP1-dependent class switch recombination (CSR) and fusion of dysfunctional telomeres. The inappropriate accumulation of RIF1 at DSBs in S phase is antagonized by BRCA1, and deletion of Rif1 suppresses toxic nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) induced by PARP inhibition in Brca1-deficient cells. Mechanistically, RIF1 is recruited to DSBs via the N-terminal phospho-SQ/TQ domain of 53BP1, and DSBs generated by ionizing radiation or during CSR are hyperresected in the absence of RIF1. Thus, RIF1 and 53BP1 cooperate to block DSB resection to promote NHEJ in G1, which is antagonized by BRCA1 in S phase to ensure a switch of DSB repair mode to homologous recombination.", "anno": [[118, 119, true], [255, 256, true], [407, 408, true], [614, 615, true], [804, 805, true], [989, 990, true]]}]}
