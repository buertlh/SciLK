A range of methods was used to quantify the PPI either at low concentration (interaction parameter (kD) obtained from dynamic light scattering, DLS) or at high concentration (solution storage modulus (G') from ultrasonic shear rheology). We also developed a novel method for the determination of PPI using the apparent radius of the protein at either low or high protein concentration determined using DLS. The PPI measurements were correlated with solution viscosity (measured by DLS using polystyrene nanospheres and ultrasonic shear rheology) as a function of pH (4-9) and ionic strength (10, 50 and 150mM). Our measurements showed that the highest solution viscosity was observed under conditions with the most negative kD, the highest apparent radius and the lowest net charge. An increase in ionic strength resulted in a change in the nature of the PPI at low pH from repulsive to attractive. In the neutral to alkaline pH region the mAbs behaved differently with respect to increase in ionic strength. Two mAbs (A and B) showed little or no effect of increasing ionic strength, whereas mAb-C showed a remarkable decrease in attractive PPI and viscosity. Previous studies have mainly investigated mAbs of the IgG1 and IgG2 subclass. We show here, for the first time, that mAbs of the IgG4 subclass behave similar as the other subclasses. By comparison of the three tested mAbs with mAbs investigated in other studies a clear linear trend emerges between the pH of strongest attractive PPI and highest solution viscosity. The determination of PPI using either kD or apparent radius is thus a useful prediction tool in the determination of solution conditions that favors low solution viscosity at high protein concentration of therapeutically used mAb molecules.

The simulations, performed within the framework of the stochastic surrogate Hamiltonian approach, give values for the arrival rate in good agreement with experimental data. Theoretical results obtained for hairpins with fewer than three A:T base pairs suggest that hole transfer along short hairpins occurs via superexchange. This mechanism is characterized by the exponential distance dependence of the arrival rate on the donor/acceptor distance, k(a) \u2243 e(-\u03b2R), with \u03b2 = 0.9 \u00c5(-1).

The double-layered wound dressing was developed with PVA/sodium alginate using a freeze-melting technique; one layer was PVA layer and the other was the drug-loaded sodium alginate layer. Its gel properties were assessed compared to single-layered wound dressings. Moreover, in vivo wound-healing effects and histopathology were calculated compared to commercial products. The double-layered wound dressing gave a similar gel fraction and Young's module as single-layered wound bandages developed with only PVA, and a similar inflammation ability and WVTR as single-layered wound dressings developed with PVA and sodium alginate. Our data indicate that these double-layered wound bandages were just as swellable, but more elastic and stronger than single-layered wound dressings comprised of the same polymers and quantities, possibly giving an acceptable level of moisture and accumulation of exudates in the wound zone. Compared to the commercial product, the double-layered wound dressing comprising 6.7% PVA, 0.5% sodium alginate and 0.01% AME significantly enhanced the wound-healing effect in the wound-healing test.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate perseverative, compulsive, stereotypical, and hyperactive behaviors, as well as serotonin and its involvement with these behaviors, in DAT gene-altered mice. RESULTS: In the open field, mean turn angle and meandering were decreased in DAT knockout (DAT-KO) mice. DAT-KO mice displayed increased hyperactivity, increased velocity, less time immobile, and a failure to habituate over time in the open field unlike their DAT wildtype (DAT-WT) and heterozygous (DAT-HET) littermates. DAT-KO mice buried fewer marbles than DAT-WT and -HET mice in an assessment of compulsive-like behaviors, likely due to extreme hyperactivity and related inattention. Stereotypical head weaving was increased in untreated DAT-KO mice. Following administration of the 5-HT(1A/7) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), stereotypical head weaving and forepaw treading were increased more in DAT-KO mice than in DAT-WT or -HET mice. By contrast, head twitches induced by treatment with the 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist (\u00b1)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane (DOI) were similar in mice of all three DAT genotypes. 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor function was intact in DAT-KO mice.

It has been shown previously that a high dose of bezafibrate (an agent added to rat chow at final concentration of 0.5%) changes mRNA levels of BCKDH-related enzymes and increases dephosphorylation of the complex leading to stimulation of liver BCKDH activity and the enhanced BCAA catabolism. The aim of the present study was to determine an in vivo effect of low, clinically relevant doses of bezafibrate on BCKDH activity in rat liver. Bezafibrate was administrated for 14 days by gastric gavage to Wistar male rats (fed low-protein chow; 8% protein) at one of the following daily doses of 5, 10 and 20mg/kgb.wt.

In conclusion, these data indicate that under conditions of dietary protein restriction low, clinically relevant doses of bezafibrate have a similar adverse effect on rat liver BCKDH activity and BCAA degradation rate as the high experimental dose.

Rat EAAT3 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injecting EAAT3 mRNA. l-Glutamate (30\u03bcM)-induced inward currents were recorded via the two-electrode voltage clamp method. Caffeine decreased EAAT3 activity in a dose-dependent manner. Caffeine (30\u03bcM for 3min) significantly reduced V(max), but did not alter K(m) value of EAAT3 for glutamate. When preincubated oocytes with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, a PKC activator) were exposed to caffeine, PMA-induced increase in EAAT3 activity was abolished. Two PKC inhibitors (chelerythrine and staurosporine) significantly reduced basal EAAT3 activity. Whereas, there were no significant differences among the PKC inhibitors, caffeine, and PKC inhibitors+caffeine groups. In similarly fashion, wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) significantly decreased EAAT3 activity, however no statistical differences were observed among the wortmannin, caffeine, and wortmannin+caffeine groups. Our results demonstrate that caffeine attenuates EAAT3 activity and this reducing effect of caffeine seems to be mediated by PKC and PI3K.", "anno": [[134, 135, true], [256, 257, true], [354, 355, true], [507, 508, true], [676, 677, true], [738, 739, true], [846, 847, true], [1012, 1013, true], [1109, 1110, true], [1228, 1229, true], [1433, 1434, true], [1572, 1573, true]]}, {"id": 23506559, "text": "In this work, Family 1 cellulose binding modules CBMCel7A and CBMCel6A were heterologously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli , and the binding properties between these CBMs and cellulose substrates were studied.

N2 adsorption and static light scattering (SLS) data were used to estimate the accessible surface area of cellulose which was then used for ITC data analysis. A new method of determining the cellulose molarity based on the available surface area for CBM binding was developed, which allows different cellulose substrates to be compared for binding experiments. The ITC results showed that the binding constant (Ka) to crystalline CNWs was \u223c10(5) M(-1) for CBMCel7A, while \u223c10(6) M(-1) for CBMCel6A, suggesting a higher binding affinity of CBMCel6A to CNWs. For Avicel, lower binding constants for both CBMs were observed, and weak bindings to PASC were characterized, suggesting that the binding between CBMCel7A,Cel6A and cellulose to some extent relates to the crystallinity of cellulose.

The further coalescence among the PMPTS particles would result in a continuous PMPTS shell around the PS core. Moreover, the hollow PSQ capsules were prepared after extraction of the PS core by organic solvent, further confirming the core/shell structure of the as-synthesized PS/PMPTS particles. Meanwhile, we also explored the application of the PS/PSQ core/shell particles as a new kind of Pickering emulsifier in the emulsion polymerization of St, and composite particles with complex patchy morphologies have been obtained finally under different ratios of styrene monomer to PS/PMPTS colloidal emulsifier.", "anno": [[158, 159, true], [314, 315, true], [570, 571, true], [1036, 1037, true], [1219, 1220, true], [1330, 1331, true], [1516, 1517, true], [1831, 1832, true]]}, {"id": 23174144, "text": "It is unclear whether copper nanoparticles are more toxic than traditional forms of dissolved copper. This study aimed to describe the pathologies in gill, gut, liver, kidney, brain and muscle of juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, exposed in triplicate to either a control (no added Cu), 20 or 100 \u03bcg l(-1) of either dissolved Cu (as CuSO(4)) or Cu-NPs (mean primary particle size of 87 \u00b1 27 nm) in a semi-static waterborne exposure regime. Fish were sampled at days 0, 4, and 10 for histology. All treatments caused organ injuries, and the kinds of pathologies observed with Cu-NPs were broadly of the same type as CuSO(4) including: hyperplasia, aneurisms, and necrosis in the secondary lamellae of the gills; swelling of goblet cells, necrosis in the mucosa layer and vacuole formation in the gut; hepatitis-like injury and cells with pyknotic nuclei in the liver; damage to the epithelium of some renal tubules and increased Bowman's space in the kidney. In the brain, some mild changes were observed in the nerve cell bodies in the telencephalon, alteration in the thickness of the mesencephalon layers, and enlargement of blood vessel on the ventral surface of the cerebellum. Changes in the proportional area of muscle fibres were observed in skeletal muscle. Overall the data showed that pathology from CuSO(4) and Cu-NPs were of similar types, but there were some material-type effects in the severity or incidence of injuries with Cu-NPs causing more injury in the intestine, liver and brain than the equivalent concentration of CuSO(4) by the end of the experiment, but in the gill and muscle CuSO(4) caused more pathology.", "anno": [[100, 101, true], [449, 450, true], [503, 504, true], [967, 968, true], [1191, 1192, true], [1275, 1276, true], [1643, 1644, true]]}, {"id": 23428960, "text": "Several tests to assess skin sensitization hazard are in peer-review for pre-validation. These tests, as well as the animal tests they aim to replace, were developed (and validated) for the testing of pure substances. However, in the cosmetic field, active ingredients are often mixtures from natural sources. It is therefore important to understand which tests could be used to evaluate their safety. Here we describe a proof-of-concept study to test whether the KeratinoSens(\u2122) assay is able to detect sensitizing constituents within botanical mixtures. Four extracts were spiked with different doses of the sensitizers citral, cinnamic aldehyde and isoeugenol. The tested extracts were negative in the test whereas they became positive in most cases when spiked with the sensitizers. Analysis of the results from the samples spiked with different doses allowed the determination of the minimal level of sensitizers being detectable. The contribution to sensitization potential of doses of 2% and above of the spiked sensitizers were reliably detected. There were limitations for an extract with high cytotoxicity, in which case detection of the artificially spiked sensitizers proved difficult. This study gives a proof of principle for testing of mixtures in the KeratinoSens(\u2122) assay and indicates how sensitive the assay is to detect minor components with sensitizing potential.", "anno": [[87, 88, true], [216, 217, true], [308, 309, true], [400, 401, true], [554, 555, true], [662, 663, true], [785, 786, true], [934, 935, true], [1053, 1054, true], [1196, 1197, true], [1383, 1384, true]]}, {"id": 23265893, "text": "Receptor targeting ligands for imaging and/or therapy of cancer are limited by heterogeneity of receptor expression by tumor cells, both inter-patient and intra-patient. It is often more important for imaging agents to identify local and distant spread of disease than it is to identify a specific receptor presence. Two natural hormone peptide receptors, GRPR and Y1, are specifically interesting because expression of GRPR, Y1 or both is up-regulated in most breast cancers. We describe here the design and development of a new heterobivalent peptide ligand, truncated bombesin (t-BBN)/BVD15-DO3A, for dual-targeting of GRPR and Y1, and validation of its dual binding capability. Such a probe should be useful in imaging cells, tissues and tumors that are GRPR and/or Y1 positive and should target radioisotopes, for example, (68)Ga and/or (177)Lu, to more tumors cells than single GRPR or Y1 targeted probes. A GRP targeting ligand, J-G-Abz4-QWAVGHLM-NH(2) (J-G-Abz4-t-BBN), and an Y1 targeting ligand, INP-K[\u03b5-J-(\u03b1-DO3A-\u03b5-DGa)-K]-YRLRY-NH(2)([\u03b5-J-(\u03b1-DO3A-\u03b5-DGa)-K]-BVD-15), were synthesized and coupled to produce the heterobivalent ligand, t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A. Competitive displacement binding assays using t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A against (125)I-Tyr(4)-BBN yielded an IC(50) value of 18 \u00b1 0.7 nM for GRPR in T-47D cells, a human breast cancer cell line. A similar assay using t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A against porcine (125)I-NPY showed IC(50) values of 80 \u00b1 11 nM for Y1 receptor in MCF7 cells, another human breast cancer cell line.
