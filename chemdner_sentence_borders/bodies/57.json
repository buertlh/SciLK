Here, the structure of SELPs is further modified to include a sequence that is sensitive to matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs are a ubiquitous family of extracellular matrix-modifying enzymes that are commonly associated with numerous vital processes. Increased levels of MMPs are found at high levels locally in many types of solid tumors. By modifying the SELP backbone with MMP-sensitive peptide sequences, a hydrogel that is degradable by MMPs was produced. The MMP-sensitivity of the polymer was examined by incubation with MMP-2 and MMP-9, which yielded complete cleavage of all full-length polymers by 36 hours and 48 hours, respectively, with no observable effect on unmodified SELP. Hydrogel sensitivity was tested by exposure to MMP-2 or MMP-9 for 2 weeks, during which samples were taken to analyze protein loss from the hydrogel and release of 100 nm fluorescent beads.

With numerous anti-resorptive agents available to treat bone disease, understanding their impact on bone repair is vital. Further, in light of recent work suggesting osteoclast activity may not be necessary during early endochondral fracture union, we hypothesize instead a pivotal role of MMP secreting cells in driving this process. While the role of MMPs in fracture healing has been examined, no directly comparative experiments exist. We examined a number of anti-resorptive treatments to either block osteoclast activity, including the potent bisphosphonates zoledronic acid (ZA) and clodronate (CLOD), which work via differing mechanisms, or antagonize osteoclastogenesis with recombinant OPG (HuOPG-Fc), comparing these directly to an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity (MMI270). Endochondral ossification to union occurred normally in all anti-resorptive groups. In contrast, MMP inhibition greatly impaired endochondral union, significantly delaying cartilage callus removal. MMP inhibition also produced smaller, denser hard calluses. Hard callus remodeling was, as expected, delayed with ZA, CLOD and OPG treatment at 4 and 6 weeks, resulting in larger more mineralized calluses at 6 weeks. As a result of reduced hard callus turnover, bone formation was reduced with anti-resorptive agents at these time points. These results confirm that the achievement of endochondral fracture union occurs independently of osteoclast activity. Alternatively, MMP secretion by invading cells is obligatory to endochondral union.

Such urothelial mediators activate underlying afferents and thus may contribute to normal bladder sensation and possibly to the development of bladder overactivity. The muscle-contracting and pain-inducing peptide bradykinin is produced in various inflammatory and non-inflammatory pathologies associated with bladder overactivity, but the effect of bradykinin on human urothelial function has not yet been characterized. The human urothelial cell line UROtsa expresses mRNA for both B1 and B2 subtypes of bradykinin receptors, as determined by real-time PCR. Bradykinin concentration-dependently (pEC50=8.3, Emax 4434\u00b1277nM) increased urothelial intracellular calcium levels and induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2. Activation of both bradykinin-induced signaling pathways was completely abolished by the B2 antagonist icatibant (1\u03bcM), but not the B1 antagonist R715 (1\u03bcM). Bradykinin-induced (100nM) B2 receptor activation markedly increased (192\u00b113% of control levels) stretch-induced ATP release from UROtsa in hypotonic medium, the effect being dependent on intracellular calcium elevations. UROtsa cells also expressed mRNA and protein for NGF and spontaneously released NGF to the medium in the course of hours (11.5\u00b11.4pgNGF/mgprotein/h). Bradykinin increased NGF mRNA expression and accelerated urothelial NGF release to 127\u00b15% in a protein kinase C- and ERK1/2-dependent manner. Finally, bradykinin up-regulated mRNA for transient-receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) sensory ion channel in UROtsa. In conclusion, we show that bradykinin represents a versatile modulator of human urothelial phenotype, accelerating stretch-induced ATP release, spontaneous release of NGF, as well as expression of sensory ion channel TRPV1.

Using in vitro single-cell recording techniques in mouse brain slices, we examined the physiological effects of KOR activation in CeA on GABAergic neurotransmission and its interaction with acute ethanol. A selective KOR agonist (U69593, 1 \u03bcM) diminished evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) by 18% (n = 10) in the CeA, whereas blockade of KORs with a selective antagonist (nor-binaltorphimine, 1 \u03bcM) augmented the baseline evoked GABAergic IPSCs by 14% (p < 0.01; n = 34), suggesting that the KOR system contributes to tonic inhibition of GABAergic neurotransmission in the CeA. In addition, the enhancement by acute ethanol of GABAergic IPSC amplitudes in the CeA was further augmented by pharmacological blockade of KORs, from 14 % (n = 36) to 27% (n = 26; p < 0.01), or by genetic deletion of KORs, from 14 % in WT mice (n = 19) to 34 % in KOR knockout (KO) mice (n = 13, p < 0.01), suggesting that the KOR system regulates acute ethanol actions in the CeA.

We demonstrate the approach by developing the combined binding and allosteric hotspots blueprint for CD4/gp120, the initial interaction leading to HIV-1 cell infection. A major finding of these studies is that not all binding hotspots are allosteric hotspots opening the possibility for the rational design of inhibitors and antagonist or agonist modulators.", "anno": [[184, 185, true], [412, 413, true], [546, 547, true], [739, 740, true], [908, 909, true], [1098, 1099, true]]}, {"id": 23515287, "text": "Testosterone has been shown to suppress the acute stress-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; however, the mechanisms underlying this response remain unclear. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is regulated by a neuroendocrine subpopulation of medial parvocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). These neurons are devoid of androgen receptors (ARs). Therefore, a possibility is that the PVN target neurons respond to a metabolite in the testosterone catabolic pathway via an AR-independent mechanism. The dihydrotestosterone metabolite, 5\u03b1-androstane-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol (3\u03b2-diol), binds and activates estrogen receptor-\u03b2 (ER-\u03b2), the predominant ER in the PVN. In the PVN, ER-\u03b2 is coexpressed with oxytocin (OT). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that 3\u03b2-diol regulates OT expression through ER-\u03b2 activation. Treatment of ovariectomized rats with estradiol benzoate or 3\u03b2-diol for 4 days increased OT mRNA selectively in the midcaudal, but not rostral PVN compared with vehicle-treated controls. 3\u03b2-Diol treatment also increased OT mRNA in the hypothalamic N38 cell line in vitro. The functional interactions between 3\u03b2-diol and ER-\u03b2 with the human OT promoter were examined using an OT promoter-luciferase reporter construct (OT-luc). In a dose-dependent manner, 3\u03b2-diol treatment increased OT-luc activity when cells were cotransfected with ER-\u03b2, but not ER-\u03b1. The 3\u03b2-diol-induced OT-luc activity was reduced by deletion of the promoter region containing the composite hormone response element (cHRE). Point mutations of the cHRE also prevented OT-luc activation by 3\u03b2-diol. These results indicate that 3\u03b2-diol induces OT promoter activity via ER-\u03b2-cHRE interactions.", "anno": [[183, 184, true], [360, 361, true], [414, 415, true], [565, 566, true], [717, 718, true], [769, 770, true], [867, 868, true], [1054, 1055, true], [1139, 1140, true], [1294, 1295, true], [1421, 1422, true], [1562, 1563, true], [1635, 1636, true], [1728, 1729, true]]}, {"id": 23591125, "text": "The 'vascular depression' hypothesis has recently attracted significant research attention, although the causal relationship between vascular-related injuries and depression has not been established. Here, we show that one episode of cerebral ischemia was sufficient to greatly increase the sensitivity of rats to potentially depressogenic events, evaluated at below-threshold intensities in the open space swim test. The induced 'ischemic depression' was lasting and sensitive to an acute administration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor or bryostatin-1, a relatively selective activator of protein kinase C\u03b5, during the induction phase. Chronic treatment with bryostatin-1 (5 weeks) after the induction of depressive behavior reversed the depressive immobility and produced a lasting therapeutic effect, which remained effective 3 weeks after discontinuation of the treatment. Similar treatment with alaproclate, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in contrast, produced temporary relief from the depressive symptoms, with the therapeutic effect disappearing soon after the end of the treatment. The results strongly suggest that cerebral ischemia has a direct role in shaping the sensitivity of an individual to depressogenic events and that bryostatin-1-like agents may be developed as therapeutics for treating ischemic depression in humans.", "anno": [[198, 199, true], [416, 417, true], [640, 641, true], [880, 881, true], [1105, 1106, true], [1354, 1355, true]]}, {"id": 23586436, "text": "We have employed in situ X-ray reflectivity (IXRR) to study the adsorption of a variety of proteins (lysozyme, cytochrome c, myoglobin, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and immunoglobulin G) on model hydrophilic (silicon oxide) and hydrophobic surfaces (octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayers), evaluating this recently developed technique for its applicability in the area of biomolecular studies. We report herein the highest resolution depiction of adsorbed protein films, greatly improving on the precision of previous neutron reflectivity (NR) results and previous IXRR studies. We were able to perform complete scans in 5 min or less with the maximum momentum transfer of at least 0.52 \u00c5(-1), allowing for some time-resolved information about the evolution of the protein film structure. The three smallest proteins (lysozyme, cytochrome c, and myoglobin) were seen to deposit as fully hydrated, nondenatured molecules onto hydrophilic surfaces, with indications of particular preferential orientations. Time evolution was observed for both lysozyme and myoglobin films. The larger proteins were not observed to deposit on the hydrophilic substrates, perhaps because of contrast limitations. On hydrophobic surfaces, all proteins were seen to denature extensively in a qualitatively similar way but with a rough trend that the larger proteins resulted in lower coverage. We have generated high-resolution electron density profiles of these denatured films, including capturing the growth of a lysozyme film. Because the solution interface of these denatured films is diffuse, IXRR cannot unambiguously determine the film extent and coverage, a drawback compared to NR. X-ray radiation damage was systematically evaluated, including the controlled exposure of protein films to high-intensity X-rays and exposure of the hydrophobic surface to X-rays before adsorption. Our analysis showed that standard measuring procedures used for XRR studies may lead to altered protein films; therefore, we used modified procedures to limit the influence of X-ray damage.", "anno": [[403, 404, true], [588, 589, true], [798, 799, true], [1014, 1015, true], [1081, 1082, true], [1202, 1203, true], [1381, 1382, true], [1518, 1519, true], [1679, 1680, true], [1877, 1878, true], [2067, 2068, true]]}]}
