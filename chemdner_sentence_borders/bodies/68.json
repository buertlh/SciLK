Our results indicate baicalein might be an efficacious anti-osteosarcoma drug. We found that baicalein could inhibit cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, we demonstrated that baicalein promotes osteosarcoma cell apoptosis, and our mechanistic studies suggest that this is mediated by caspase activation, especially caspase-3. We also showed that the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and concurrent increase in Bax and Bim levels contribute to the apoptosis induced by baicalein. In addition, we observed that baicalein induces G1 cell cycle arrest by decreasing cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Furthermore, our data verifies that baicalein can reduce osteosarcoma cell adhesion, migration and invasion in vitro, which indicates its potential to inhibit osteosarcoma metastasis. The decrease in expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 may contribute to the effects of baicalein.

For granulocytes, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, clopidogrel carboxylate and prasugrel were concentration-dependently toxic starting at 10\u03bcM. Cytotoxicity could be prevented by the myeloperoxidase inhibitor rutin, but not by the cytochrome P450 inhibitor ketoconazole. All compounds were also toxic for lymphocytes, but cytotoxicity started at 100\u03bcM and could not be prevented by rutin or ketoconazole. Granulocytes metabolized ticlopidine, clopidogrel, clopidogrel carboxylate and prasugrel, and metabolization was inhibited by rutin, but not by ketoconazole. Metabolism of these compounds by lymphocytes was much slower and could not be inhibited by ketoconazole or rutin. In neutrophils, all compounds investigated decreased the electrical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane, were associated with cellular accumulation of ROS, mitochondrial loss of cytochrome c and induction of apoptosis starting at 10\u03bcM. All of these effects could be inhibited by rutin, but not by ketoconazole. Similar findings were obtained in lymphocytes; but compared to neutrophils, the effects were detectable only at higher concentrations and were not inhibited by rutin. In conclusion, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, clopidogrel carboxylate and prasugrel are toxic for both granulocytes and lymphocytes.

This mechanism of action predicts that benzodiazepines reduce the frequency of inhibition-driven network oscillations, consistent with observations from human and animal EEG. However, most of existing data are restricted to frequency bands below \u223c30 Hz. Recent data suggest that faster cortical network rhythms are critically involved in several behavioral and cognitive tasks. We therefore analyzed diazepam effects on a large range of cortical network oscillations in freely moving mice, including theta (4-12 Hz), gamma (40-100 Hz) and fast gamma (120-160 Hz) oscillations. We also investigated diazepam effects over the coupling between theta phase and the amplitude fast oscillations. We report that diazepam causes a global slowing of oscillatory activity in all frequency domains. Oscillation power was changed differently for each frequency domain, with characteristic differences between active wakefulness, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. Cross-frequency coupling strength, in contrast, was mostly unaffected by diazepam.

Glycyrrhizic acid (GA, also known as Glycyrrhizin), a triterpenoid saponin glycoside, is considered to be a bioactive component in Licorice and is beneficial to diabetic vascular complications. AIM OF STUDY: The present study was conducted to evaluate the potential protective activities on AGEs-induced endothelial dysfunction, including anti-apoptosis, antioxidant stress and anti-proinflammatory responses, and explore the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated and pre-treated with GA (10(-9)-10(-6)M) or RAGE-Ab (5\u03bcg/ml) in the presence or absence of 200\u03bcg/ml AGEs. AO/EB fluorescence staining assay was performed to evaluate anti-apoptosis activity. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in cell supernatant were detected by kits while the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was determined by 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) kit. Immunocytochemistry analysis was designed to determine transforming growth factor beta1(TGF-\u03b21) protein expression while immunofluorescence analysis for RAGE and NF-kB. The protein expressions of TGF-\u03b21, RAGE and NF-kB were analyzed by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Pretreatment with GA at a concentration of 10(-8)-10(-6)M significantly reduced the AGEs-induced apoptosis in HUVECs. GA significantly increased antioxidant enzyme SOD activity and decreased peroxide degradation product MDA level in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GA also remarkably inhibited the overgeneration of AGEs-induced ROS. Both immunocytochemistry analysis and western blot analysis showed that GA significantly decreased the protein expression of poinflammatory cytokine TGF-\u03b21 in a similar manner which RAGE-Ab did. Additionally, AGEs-induced RAGE and NF-kB protein expressions were down-regulated significantly by the pretreatment with GA or RAGE-Ab. CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidences that GA possesses protective activity on AGEs-induced endothelial dysfunction, including anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation and antioxidant stress, via inhibiting RAGE/NF-kB pathway.

To investigate this, the estrogenic environment was modified through inhibition of aromatase activity, blockade of nuclear estrogen receptors, or estrogenic treatments. Estrogens significantly decreased cell proliferation and migration at the olfactory bulbs/telencephalon junction and in the mediobasal hypothalamus. It also appears that cell survival is reduced at the olfactory bulbs/telencephalon junction.

Proliferation increased rapidly immediately after the lesion in the parenchyma of the injured telencephalon, while proliferation at the ventricular surface appeared after 48 h and peaked at 7 days.

Remarkably, many of the splicing differences that distinguish normal mesenchymal from normal epithelial tissues matched those that differentiate normal ovarian tissues from ovarian cancer. Furthermore, because splicing profiling could classify cancer cell lines according to their epithelial/mesenchymal characteristics, we used these cancer cell lines to identify regulators for these specific splicing signatures. By knocking down 78 potential splicing factors in five cell lines, we provide an extensive view of the complex regulatory landscape associated with the epithelial and mesenchymal states, thus revealing that RBFOX2 is an important driver of mesenchymal tissue-specific splicing.", "anno": [[178, 179, true], [394, 395, true], [596, 597, true], [785, 786, true], [1012, 1013, true], [1290, 1291, true]]}, {"id": 22720714, "text": "The phytochemical investigation of extracts from the root barks of Lycium chinense yielded a new furolactone-type lignan, lyciumin (1).

This diet increases the plasma levels of medium straight chain fatty acids. A role for these and related fatty acids in seizure control has not been established. We compared the potency of an established epilepsy treatment, Valproate (VPA), with a range of MCT diet-associated fatty acids (and related branched compounds), using in vitro seizure and in vivo epilepsy models, and assessed side effect potential in vitro for one aspect of teratogenicity, for liver toxicology and in vivo for sedation, and for a neuroprotective effect. We identify specific medium chain fatty acids (both prescribed in the MCT diet, and related compounds branched on the fourth carbon) that provide significantly enhanced in vitro seizure control compared to VPA. The activity of these compounds on seizure control is independent of histone deacetylase inhibitory activity (associated with the teratogenicity of VPA), and does not correlate with liver cell toxicity. In vivo, these compounds were more potent in epilepsy control (perforant pathway stimulation induced status epilepticus), showed less sedation and enhanced neuroprotection compared to VPA. Our data therefore implicates medium chain fatty acids in the mechanism of the MCT ketogenic diet, and highlights a related new family of compounds that are more potent than VPA in seizure control with a reduced potential for side effects.
