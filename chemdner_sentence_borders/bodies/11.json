Additionally, cancer progression may be partly regulated by CBR1. In the present study, we screened more than 10 drugs for the induction of the human CBR1 gene to investigate its regulation. Of the drugs, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was found to be an inducer. BHA induced the mRNA and protein expression of CBR1 in hepatoma HepG2 cells. In a luciferase reporter gene assay, the promoter region between -2062 bp and the transcription start site of CBR1 was also activated by BHA. The transcription factor Nrf2 is known to be activated by BHA. There are 2 anti-oxidant responsive elements (ARE) that are bound by Nrf2 in this region. Mutation analyses revealed that one of the AREs participates in the gene regulation of CBR1 by Nrf2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that Nrf2 binds the site. Moreover, to determine whether the functional ARE of CBR1 is conserved with the promoter region of homologues in other species, the nucleotide sequences of the functional AREs of the Chcr1 and Chcr2 genes, which are the Chinese hamster homologues of CBR1, were determined. The region has 2 AREs, and these genes were also induced by the forced expression of Nrf2 (cotransfection of pNrf2) in the luciferase reporter gene assay. In conclusion, Nrf2 is a novel transcriptional regulator of CBR1 genes in humans and the Chinese hamster. Because the regulation of CBR1 appears to be important for diseases, the induction of CBR1 by Nrf2 may be a therapeutic target.", "anno": [[266, 267, true], [332, 333, true], [457, 458, true], [530, 531, true], [607, 608, true], [749, 750, true], [812, 813, true], [902, 903, true], [1003, 1004, true], [1075, 1076, true], [1348, 1349, true], [1503, 1504, true], [1609, 1610, true], [1737, 1738, true]]}, {"id": 23247040, "text": "We sought to modify adenoviral (Ad) particles by incorporating the advantageous characteristics of non-viral gene delivery vehicles to complement the viral vectors. \u03b1-Amino acid-N-carboxyanhydride chemistry was used to synthesize homopolypeptides and diblock copolypeptides that possess well-defined secondary structures.

The cyclic dimer is the most stable structure both in gas phase and solution. Dimer mono- and dihydrates could be found in the gas phase if acid molecules are in contact with water vapor. However, the formation of these hydrated conformers is very limited and cyclic dimer is the principal conformer to coexist with monomer acid in solution. Solvation of the cyclic dimer is more favorable compared to other complexes, partially due to the diminishing of hydrogen bonding capability and annihilation of dipole moments. Solvents have a strong effect on inducing dimer dissociation and this dependence is more pronounced at low dielectric constants. By accounting for selected terms in the total free energy of solvation, the solvation entropy could be incorporated to predict the dimer behavior at elevated temperatures. The temperature dependence of benzoic acid dimerization obtained by this technique is in good agreement with available experimental measurements, in which a tendency of dimer to dissociate is observed with increased temperatures.

These structural parameters are (i) the torsion angle governing the conjugation of the organic radical m-PyNO (anti versus gauche), (ii) the coordination geometry of the acetyl acetonate ligands around the metal ion (square versus rhombic), and (iii) the relative orientation of the organic radical with respect to the acetyl acetonate plane (parallel versus perpendicular).

Under the conditions used for these experiments, it can be deduced that resveratrol is more efficient than trolox as an antioxidant, also in the inner skin layers. The cosmeto-textiles with an active substance incorporated into their structure are increasingly used in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. The action of several cosmeto-textiles on the skin was assessed by in vitro and in vivo methodologies. Samples of these cosmeto-textiles were prepared with resveratrol incorporated into cotton and polyamide fabrics. An in vitro percutaneous absorption was used to demonstrate the delivery of the resveratrol from the textile to the different skin layers (stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis). Additionally, these cosmeto-textiles containing the antioxidant were applied onto the forearms of volunteers to evaluate the textiles' efficacy in skin penetration. The antioxidant's antiradical capacity was evaluated using the DPPH method. Results showed that resveratrol could be detected in the dermis, epidermis, and stratum corneum (SC) by an in vitro percutaneous absorption method and was also detected in the outermost layers of the SC by an in vivo method (stripping). A smaller amount of resveratrol was penetrated through the skin layers when cosmeto-textiles were used compared to direct topical application of the antioxidant solution. The cosmeto-textiles investigated can act as a reservoir system capable of progressively deliver the active substance to the skin layers. From the skin penetration profiles and the antioxidant efficacy assessment of resveratrol, it is possible to ameliorate the inherent antioxidant capacity of skin.", "anno": [[120, 121, true], [218, 219, true], [355, 356, true], [464, 465, true], [556, 557, true], [666, 667, true], [768, 769, true], [932, 933, true], [1082, 1083, true], [1185, 1186, true], [1298, 1299, true], [1478, 1479, true], [1643, 1644, true], [1719, 1720, true], [1956, 1957, true], [2127, 2128, true], [2265, 2266, true], [2428, 2429, true]]}, {"id": 23262203, "text": "Effective drug delivery to tumors requires both transport through the vasculature and tumor interstitium.

Furthermore, we found that rhubarb suppressed the p-ser(9) GSK-3-\u03b2 protein level to inactivate Wnt signalling and reduce \u03b2-catenin protein level. Taken together; we found that rhubarb blocked the metastatic process of HA22T hepatocellular carcinoma cells mediated through GSK-3-\u03b2 activation, and enhancement of protein degradation as well as reduction of the nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin.", "anno": [[142, 143, true], [299, 300, true], [484, 485, true], [608, 609, true], [754, 755, true], [1002, 1003, true]]}, {"id": 23265491, "text": "Groundnut (Apios americana Medik) contains a novel isoflavone, genistein-7-O-gentiobioside. In the present study, we examined the biological activities of an alcohol extract of groundnut containing genistein-7-O-gentiobioside as the main component. Although the groundnut extract by itself did not show antioxidative activity, it drove the antioxidative system in cells. Pretreatment of human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells for 24 h with the groundnut extract and soybean isoflavone increased gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a major antioxidative stress enzyme. These groundnut extract-treated cells showed antioxidative activity against free radicals derived from a radical initiator. Pretreatment of cells with 100 \u03bcg/mL groundnut extract prevented the depletion of glutathione by the radical initiator; however, treatment with 100 \u03bcg/mL of soybean isoflavone injured the cell membrane, indicating that glutathione might be released to the extracellular environment. These results suggest that the groundnut extract had isoflavone-like activity.

The real-time PCR method does not show any cross-reactivity with other Brassicaceae species with the exception of white mustard. Low cross-reactivities with cinnamon, cumin, fenugreek, ginger, rye and turmeric can be ignored because in common mustard containing foodstuffs these biological species are present in very low amounts.
