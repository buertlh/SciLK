STAT5b(A630P) was found to be an inactive transcription factor based on its aberrant folding, diminished solubility, and propensity for aggregation triggered by its misfolded SH2 domain. Here we have characterized the second human STAT5b amino acid substitution mutation in an individual with similar pathophysiological features. This single nucleotide transition, predicted to change phenyalanine 646 to serine (F646S), also maps to the SH2 domain. Like STAT5b(A630P), STAT5b(F646S) is prone to aggregation, as evidenced by its detection in the insoluble fraction of cell extracts, the presence of dimers and higher-order oligomers in the soluble fraction, and formation of insoluble cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in cells. Unlike STAT5b(A630P), which showed minimal GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and no transcriptional activity, STAT5b(F646S) became tyrosine phosphorylated after GH treatment and could function as a GH-activated transcription factor, although to a substantially lesser extent than STAT5b(WT). Biochemical characterization demonstrated that the isolated SH2 domain containing the F646S substitution closely resembled the wild-type SH2 domain in secondary structure, but exhibited reduced thermodynamic stability and altered tertiary structure that were intermediate between STAT5b(A630P) and STAT5b(WT).

We compared the cost-effectiveness of FXaIs with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. DESIGN: A decision-tree model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of oral direct FXaIs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) to subcutaneous LMWHs (enoxaparin and dalteparin), with separate models for THR and TKR. The analysis was conducted over a 180-day postoperative time horizon from the U.S. Medicare perspective. The model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2011 (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA). METHODS: Efficacy and safety data (probabilities of distal and proximal deep vein thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, and major bleeding) were derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis of phase II and III clinical trials. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are reported. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: In the THR model, the average costs per patient for FXaIs and LMWHs were $18,762 and $18,897, respectively, and the QALYs were 0.938 and 0.932. In the TKR model, the average cost per patient for FXaIs and LMWHs were $18,804 and $18,991, respectively, and the QALYs were 0.935 and 0.931.

Transgenic mice lacking P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) were used to study efflux of erlotinib at the BBB. A U87 rat xenograft model of GBM was used to investigate the regional distribution of erlotinib to the tumor, and brain regions surrounding the tumor. The effect of concurrent administration of elacridar on regional tumor distribution of erlotinib was evaluated. We show that erlotinib transport across an intact BBB is significantly restricted due to P-gp- and Bcrp-mediated efflux transport. We then show that the BBB is sufficiently intact in areas of brain adjacent to the tumor core to significantly restrict erlotinib delivery. Inhibition of P-gp and Bcrp by the dual inhibitor elacridar dramatically increased erlotinib delivery to the tumor core, rim, and normal brain. These results provide conclusive evidence of the impact that active efflux at the BBB has on the delivery of molecularly targeted therapy to different tumor regions in glioma.

C. albicans possesses a potent armamentarium consisting of several virulence molecules that help the fungal cells to escape from the host immune responses.

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for a planar TIP4P-Ew water surface at four temperatures in the range 268-300 K as well as two droplets, with radii of 1.92 and 4.14 nm at T = 273.15 K.

The droplet size was found to have minimal effect on the value of the mass accommodation coefficient. The mass accommodation coefficient was found to be unity (within 0.004) for all studied surfaces, which is in agreement with previous simulation work.

CTRC stimulates trypsinogen autoactivation by processing the activation peptide to a shorter form but also promotes degradation by cleaving the calcium binding loop in trypsinogen. Mutations render trypsinogen resistant to CTRC-mediated degradation and/or increase processing of the activation peptide by CTRC. Here we demonstrate that activation peptide mutations D19A, D22G, K23R and K23_I24insIDK robustly increased the rate of trypsinogen autoactivation, both in the presence and absence of CTRC. Degradation of the mutants by CTRC was unchanged and processing of the activation peptide was increased only in the D19A mutant by 4-fold. Surprisingly, however, this increased processing had only a minimal effect on autoactivation. The tetra-aspartate motif in the trypsinogen activation peptide binds calcium (KD ~1.6 mM), which stimulates autoactivation. Unexpectedly, calcium binding was not compromised by any of the activation peptide mutations. Despite normal binding, autoactivation of mutants D22G and K23_I24insIDK was not stimulated by calcium. Finally, the activation peptide mutants exhibited reduced secretion from transfected cells, and secreted trypsinogen levels were inversely proportional with autoactivation rates. We conclude that D19A, D22G, K23R and K23_I24insIDK form a mechanistically distinct subset of hereditary pancreatitis associated mutations, which exert their effect primarily through direct stimulation of autoactivation, independently of CTRC. The potentially severe clinical impact of the markedly increased autoactivation is offset by diminished secretion, resulting in a clinical phenotype indistinguishable from typical hereditary pancreatitis.

In particular, it is unclear whether activation of mGlu3 receptors is sufficient to induce LTD at synapses in the CNS. In the present study, advantage was taken of a Wistar rat strain not expressing mGlu2 receptors (Ceolin et al., 2011) to investigate the function of mGlu3 receptors in the amygdala. In this preparation, the group II agonist, DCG-IV induced an LTD of the cortical, but not the intra-nuclear, synaptic input to the lateral amygdala. This LTD was concentration dependent and was blocked by the group II mGlu receptor antagonist, LY341495. To investigate further the role of mGlu3 receptors, we used LY395756 (an mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist), which acts as a pure mGlu3 receptor antagonist in this rat strain. This compound alone had no effect on basal synaptic transmission, but blocked the LTD induced by DCG-IV. Furthermore, we found that DCG-IV also induces LTD in mGlu2 receptor knock-out (KO) mice to a similar extent as in wild-type mice. This confirms that the activation of mGlu3 receptors alone is sufficient to induce LTD at this amygdala synapse. To address whether mGlu2 activation alone is also sufficient to induce LTD at this synapse we used LY541850 (the active enantiomer of LY395756) in wild-type mice.

AIM OF THE REVIEW: To provide an up-to-date overview of the botany, phytochemistry, traditional uses, pharmacological activities and toxicity data of Waltheria indica. Additionally, studies providing an evidence for local and traditional uses of Waltheria indica are discussed. Further phytochemical and pharmacological potential of this species are suggested for future investigations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The information was collected from scientific journals, books, theses and reports via academic libraries and electronic search. These sources include Pubmed, Web of Science, Portal de Portales-Latindex, Science Research.com and Google scholar. These studies about the medical botanical, traditional uses, chemical, pharmacological and toxicological data on Waltheria indica were published in English, Portuguese, Spanish, German and French. RESULTS: Crude extracts and isolated compounds from Waltheria indica were investigated and showed analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, anti-anemic, anti-oxidant, sedative and anticonvulsant activities. The phytochemical investigations showed the presence of cyclopeptid alkaloids, flavonoids (e.g., (-)-epicatechin, quercetin, kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-d-(6\u2033-E-p-coumaryl)-glucopyranoside), tannins, sterols, terpenes, saponins, anthraquinones.

We demonstrate that these drugs display single-agent activity, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. The drugs produce cytotoxic effects in cell lines that are most sensitive to these drugs, whereas normal cells are only sensitive to these drugs at the higher concentrations where they have cytostatic activity. The cytotoxic effect is the consequence of inhibition of S-phase Chk1, which drives cells prematurely from late S phase into an aberrant mitosis and results in either failure of cytokinesis or cell death through an apoptotic mechanism. The sensitivity to the Chk1 inhibitors was correlated with the level of endogenous DNA damage indicating replicative stress. Chk1 inhibitors are viable single-agent therapies that target melanoma cells with high levels of endogenous DNA damage.

This work demonstrates the ability of pH-responsive, endosomolytic nanoparticles to actively promote antigen cross-presentation and augment cellular and humoral immune responses via dual-delivery of protein antigens and CpG ODN. Hence, pH-responsive polymeric nanoparticles offer promise as a delivery platform for protein subunit vaccines.", "anno": [[159, 160, true], [371, 372, true], [688, 689, true], [817, 818, true], [995, 996, true], [1229, 1230, true], [1582, 1583, true], [1725, 1726, true], [1871, 1872, true], [2100, 2101, true], [2212, 2213, true]]}, {"id": 23520133, "text": "Neuraminidases (sialidases) catalyze the removal of sialic acid residues from sialylated glycoconjugates. We now report that mammalian neuraminidase 1 (Neu1), in addition to its catabolic function in lysosomes, is transported to the cell surface where it is involved in regulation of insulin signaling. Insulin binding to its receptor rapidly induces interaction of the receptor with Neu1, which hydrolyzes sialic acid residues in the glycan chains of the receptor and, consequently, induces its activation. Cells from sialidosis patients with a genetic deficiency of Neu1 show impairment of insulin-induced phosphorylation of downstream protein kinase AKT, while treatment of these cells with purified Neu1 restores signaling. Genetically-modified mice with \u223c10% of the normal Neu1 activity exposed to a high-fat diet develop hyperglycemia and insulin resistance twice as fast as their wild type counterparts. Together, these studies identify Neu1 as a novel component of the signaling pathways of energy metabolism and glucose uptake.", "anno": [[104, 105, true], [301, 302, true], [506, 507, true], [726, 727, true], [909, 910, true], [1035, 1036, true]]}, {"id": 23548704, "text": "Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) has been reported to regulate various genes involved in cancer and inflammation.
