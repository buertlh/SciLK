Similarly, systemic treatment of WT mice with \u03c31 antagonists markedly potentiated morphine-induced antinociception, and its effects were reversed by the selective \u03c31 agonist PRE-084. Although the local administration of morphine (50-200\u00a0\u03bcg) was devoid of antinociceptive effects in WT mice, it induced dose-dependent antinociception in \u03c31-KO mice.

Importantly, this inhibition was specific to CYP1A1and was not radiated to other aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-regulated genes, as MeHg induced NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 mRNA and protein levels. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect of MeHg on the induction of CYP1A1 coincided with an increase in heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA levels.

RNA 3-dimensional structure alignment, on the other hand, tends to be more difficult than protein structure alignment due to the lack of regular secondary structures as observed in proteins. Most of the existing RNA 3D structure alignment methods use only the backbone geometry and ignore the sequence information. Using both the sequence and backbone geometry information in RNA alignment may not only produce more accurate classification, but also deepen our understanding of the sequence-structure-function relationship of RNA molecules.

The similarity between two RNA molecules is quantified by a formal distance, geodesic distance. Based on ESA, a rigorous mathematical framework can be built for RNA structure comparison.

In scenarios where herd protection was included we estimated that the program was likely to be cost-effective. The study also illustrates the importance of the inherent seasonal variability of influenza, which can produce counter-intuitive results, with low transmission seasons being easier to control by vaccination but resulting in fewer benefits.

STMN1 normally regulates microtubule dynamics either by sequestering free tubulin heterodimers or by promoting microtubule catastrophe. Increased expression of STMN1 has been observed in a variety of human malignancies, but its association with melanoma is unknown. We now report that STMN1 is upregulated during the progression of melanoma relative to benign nevi, and that STMN1 is directly regulated by miR-193b. Using an experimental cell culture approach, overexpression of miR-193b using synthetic microRNAs repressed STMN1 expression, whereas inhibition of miR-193b with anti-miR oligos increased STMN1 expression in melanoma cells. The use of a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-193b directly regulates STMN1 by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of STMN1 mRNA. We further demonstrated that STMN1 is overexpressed in malignant melanoma compared with nevi in two independent melanoma cohorts, and that its level is inversely correlated with miR-193b expression. However, STMN1 expression was not significantly associated with patient survival, Breslow depth, mitotic count or patient age. STMN1 knockdown by small-interfering RNA in melanoma cells drastically repressed cell proliferation and migration potential, whereas ectopic expression of STMN1 using lentivirus increased cell proliferation and migration rates. Subsequent gene expression analysis indicated that interconnected cytoskeletal networks are directly affected following STMN1 knockdown. In addition, we identified deregulated genes associated with proliferation and migration, and revealed that p21(Cip1/Waf1) and p27(Kip) could be downstream effectors of STMN1 signaling.

Isolated myofibers took up ethidium (Etd(+)) and released small molecules (as ATP) during electrical stimulation. Consistent with two glucose uptake pathways, induced uptake of 2-NBDG, a fluorescent glucose derivative, was decreased by inhibition of HCs or glucose transporter (GLUT4), and blocked by dual blockade. Adult skeletal muscles apparently do not express connexins, making it unlikely that connexin hemichannels contribute to the uptake and release of small molecules.

We previously developed a rat model of this skin rash that is immune-mediated and is very similar to the rash in humans. Treatment of rats with the major NVP metabolite, 12-OH-NVP, also caused the rash. Most idiosyncratic drug reactions are caused by reactive metabolites; 12-OH-NVP forms a benzylic sulfate, which was detected in the blood of animals treated with NVP or 12-OH-NVP. This sulfate is presumably formed in the liver; however, the skin also has significant sulfotransferase activity. In this study, we used a serum against NVP to detect covalent binding in the skin of rats. There was a large artifact band in immunoblots of whole skin homogenates that interfered with detection of covalent binding; however, when the skin was separated into dermal and epidermal fractions, covalent binding was clearly present in the epidermis, which is also the location of sulfotransferases. In contrast to rats, treatment of mice with NVP did not result in covalent binding in the skin or skin rash.

This is the first study to report covalent binding of NVP to rat and human skin.

The participants were young men and women, 17-21\u00a0years of age. RESULTS: Risk level (number of pumps) modulated brain activation in the right dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices more in smokers than in nonsmokers, and smoking severity (Heaviness of Smoking Index) was positively related to this modulation in an adjacent frontal region. CONCLUSIONS: Given evidence for involvement of the right dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices in inhibitory control, these findings suggest that young smokers have a different contribution of prefrontal cortical substrates to risky decision-making than nonsmokers. Future studies are warranted to determine whether the observed neurobiological differences precede or result from smoking.", "anno": [[9, 10, true], [189, 190, true], [412, 413, true], [424, 425, true], [527, 528, true], [536, 537, true], [819, 820, true], [1031, 1032, true], [1094, 1095, true], [1103, 1104, true], [1382, 1383, true], [1395, 1396, true], [1661, 1662, true], [1784, 1785, true]]}, {"id": 23625813, "text": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of kidney function estimation equations and to determine the frequency of drug dose discordance in an older population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from community-dwelling volunteers randomly selected from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010. SUBJECTS: A total of 269 men and women with a mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD age of 81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0years, mean serum creatinine concentration (Scr ) of 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 mg/dl, and mean 24-hour measured creatinine clearance (mClcr ) of 53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0ml/minute. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Kidney function was estimated by using the following equations: Cockcroft-Gault (CG), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI). The performance of each equation was assessed by measuring bias and precision relative to mClcr . Dose calculation errors (discordance) were determined for 10 drugs requiring renal dosage adjustments to avoid toxicity when compared with the dosages approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The CG equation was the least biased estimate of mClcr . The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations were significantly positively biased compared with CG (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020% and 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015%, respectively, p<0.001) and mClcr (29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a047% and 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040%, respectively, p<0.001). Rounding low Scr values (less than 1.0\u00a0mg/dl) up to an arbitrary value of 1.0\u00a0mg/dl resulted in CG values (44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0ml/minute) that were significantly lower than mClcr (56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 ml/minute, p<0.001) and CG (56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0ml/minute, p<0.001). The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations had median dose discordance rates of 28.6% and 22.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations significantly overestimated creatinine clearance (mClcr and CG) in elderly individuals. This leads to dose calculation errors for many drugs, particularly in individuals with severe renal impairment. Thus equations estimating glomerular filtration rate should not be substituted in place of the CG equation in older adults for the purpose of renal dosage adjustments. In addition, the common practice of rounding or replacing low Scr values with an arbitrary value of 1.0\u00a0mg/dl for use in the CG equation should be avoided. Additional studies that evaluate alternative eGFR equations in the older populations that incorporate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes measures are needed.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [158, 159, true], [166, 167, true], [343, 344, true], [353, 354, true], [561, 562, true], [592, 593, true], [789, 790, true], [887, 888, true], [1084, 1085, true], [1141, 1142, true], [1341, 1342, true], [1574, 1575, true], [1673, 1674, true], [1685, 1686, true], [1804, 1805, true], [1916, 1917, true], [2084, 2085, true], [2240, 2241, true], [2408, 2409, true]]}, {"id": 23301836, "text": "Atomic-scale molecular dynamics computer simulations are used to probe the structure, dynamics, and energetics of alkylamine self-assembled monolayer (SAM) films on graphene and to model the formation of molecular bilayers and protein complexes on the films. Routes toward the development and exploitation of functionalized graphene structures are detailed here, and we show that the SAM architecture can be tailored for use in emerging applications (e.g., electrically stimulated nerve fiber growth via the targeted binding of specific cell surface peptide sequences on the functionalized graphene scaffold). The simulations quantify the changes in film physisorption on graphene and the alkyl chain packing efficiency as the film surface is made more polar by changing the terminal groups from methyl (-CH(3)) to amine (-NH(2)) to hydroxyl (-OH). The mode of molecule packing dictates the orientation and spacing between terminal groups on the surface of the SAM, which determines the way in which successive layers build up on the surface, whether via the formation of bilayers of the molecule or the immobilization of other (macro)molecules (e.g., proteins) on the SAM. The simulations show the formation of ordered, stable assemblies of monolayers and bilayers of decylamine-based molecules on graphene. These films can serve as protein adsorption platforms, with a hydrophobin protein showing strong and selective adsorption by binding via its hydrophobic patch to methyl-terminated films and binding to amine-terminated films using its more hydrophilic surface regions.

A range of magnetic properties was obtained by varying the microwave power, reduction temperature and Nd to Fe ratio.
