Typically, high oral doses are required to achieve minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at the site of infection that may affect only a very small area of skin. Objectives: To lower side effects and increase therapeutic effectiveness, the percutaneous absorption and retention of AMX and CFX administered by iontophoresis was investigated in a rabbit model by measuring dermis concentrations via microdialysis. Methods: Iontophoresis was performed using a stainless steel electrode and a non-woven polypropylene pad. The cartridge pad was soaked with a solution of AMX in glycerin or of CFX in glycerin/water (60:40). Constant current density of 0, 100, 200 or 300\u2009\u00b5A/cm(2) was applied for 60\u2009min. Results: For AMX, therapeutically effective skin concentrations were detected immediately after the application of electrical current for any of the current density tested and remained above it for at least 2\u2009h from the end of iontophoresis. For CFX, skin concentrations rose above MIC only at the higher current densities and fell below the MIC by the end of the experiment.

During the 30 years since its discovery, we have learned that the dynorphin peptides are released in brain during stress exposure. After they are released, they activate kappa opioid receptors distributed throughout the brain and spinal cord, where they trigger cellular responses resulting in different stress responses: analgesia, dysphoria-like behaviors, anxiety-like responses, and increased addiction behaviors in experimental animals.

We wanted to determine whether cannabinoid treatment could induce CB1 expression in a cell culture model of striatal neurons and, if possible, determine the molecular mechanism by which this occurred.

PINK1 and Parkin accumulate on damaged mitochondria, promote their segregation from the mitochondrial network, and target these organelles for autophagic degradation in a process that requires Parkin-dependent ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins. Here we will review recent advances in our understanding of the different pathways of mitophagy. In addition, we will discuss the relevance of these pathways in neurons where defects in mitophagy have been implicated in neurodegeneration.", "anno": [[149, 150, true], [343, 344, true], [469, 470, true], [682, 683, true], [854, 855, true], [1106, 1107, true], [1203, 1204, true], [1345, 1346, true]]}, {"id": 23194542, "text": "A simple multiresidue analytical method is developed for the simultaneous determination of carbendazim (CB), thiabendazole (TB), and 6-benzyl aminopurine (6-BA) in bean sprouts.

PvdQ is an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) acylase able to degrade the signal molecule of P. aeruginosa QS. The role of PvdQ in inhibiting the QS and its successive virulence determinants has been established in in vitro as well as in in vivo, the latter in a Caenorabdhitis elegans model.

Here we show that treatment of urogenital sinus (UGS) organ cultures with known inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling also inhibits prostatic bud formation. In support of the hypothesis that TCDD decreases canonical Wnt signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of TCDD on multiple components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the UGS that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of TCDD on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of R-spondins (Rspo2 and Rspo3) that promote canonical Wnt signaling is reduced; (2) expression of Lef1, Tcf1, and Wif1, established canonical Wnt target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of Lgr5, a RSPO receptor that activates canonical Wnt signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of Dickkopfs (Dkks), inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, is not increased by TCDD. Thus, the TCDD-induced reduction in canonical Wnt signaling is associated with a decrease in activators (Rspo2 and Rspo3) rather than an increase in inhibitors (Dkk1 and Dkk2) of the pathway. This study focuses on determining whether treatment of TCDD-exposed UGS organ cultures with RSPO2 and/or RSPO3 is capable of rescuing the inhibitory effects of TCDD on canonical Wnt signaling and prostatic bud formation.

However, this is not the case; with the simple physical explanation that the electric field (which drives the heating) within a highly conducting particle is highly screened. Instead, it is the magnetic absorption associated with induction that accounts for the large experimental heating rates observed for small metal particles. We present simple principles for the effective heating of particles in microwave fields from calculations of electric and magnetic dipole absorptions for a range of practical values of particle size and conductivity. For highly conducting particles, magnetic absorption dominates electric absorption over a wide range of particle radii, with an optimum absorption set by the ratio of mean particle radius a to the skin depth \u03b4 (specifically, by the condition a = 2.41\u03b4). This means that for particles of any conductivity, optimized magnetic absorption (and hence microwave heating by magnetic induction) can be achieved by simple selection of the mean particle size. For weakly conducting samples, electric dipole absorption dominates, and is maximized when the conductivity is approximately \u03c3 \u2248 3\u03c9\u03b5(0) \u2248 0.4 S m(-1), independent of particle radius. Therefore, although electric dipole heating can be as effective as magnetic dipole heating for a powder sample of the same volume, it is harder to obtain optimized conditions at a fixed frequency of microwave field.

To investigate this, we performed a high throughput miRNA mimetic screen, which identified several miRNAs whose over-expression results in sensitization to the clinical PARP inhibitor olaparib. In particular, our findings indicate that hsa-miR-107 and hsa-miR-222 regulate the DDR and sensitise tumour cells to olaparib by repressing expression of RAD51, thus impairing DSB repair by HR. Moreover, elevated expression of hsa-miR-107 has been observed in a subset of ovarian clear cell carcinomas, which correlates with PARP inhibitor sensitivity and reduced RAD51 expression. Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers to identify patients that may benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors.", "anno": [[203, 204, true], [344, 345, true], [555, 556, true], [649, 650, true], [843, 844, true], [1037, 1038, true], [1225, 1226, true], [1403, 1404, true]]}, {"id": 23395804, "text": "Prolactin (PRL) is a well-known regulator of ion and water transport within osmoregulatory tissues across vertebrate species, yet how PRL acts on some of its target tissues remains poorly understood. Using zebrafish as a model, we show that ionocytes in the gill directly respond to systemic PRL to regulate mechanisms of ion uptake. Ion-poor conditions led to increases in the expression of PRL receptor (prlra), Na(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter (ncc; slc12a10.2), Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (nhe3b; slc9a3.2), and epithelial Ca(2+) channel (ecac; trpv6) transcripts within the gill. Intraperitoneal injection of ovine PRL (oPRL) increased ncc and prlra transcripts, but did not affect nhe3b or ecac. Consistent with direct PRL action in the gill, addition of oPRL to cultured gill filaments stimulated ncc in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect blocked by a pure human PRL receptor antagonist (\u03941-9-G129R-hPRL). These results suggest that PRL signaling through PRL receptors in the gill regulates the expression of ncc, thereby linking this pituitary hormone with an effector of Cl(-) uptake in zebrafish for the first time.", "anno": [[198, 199, true], [332, 333, true], [570, 571, true], [687, 688, true], [907, 908, true], [1120, 1121, true]]}, {"id": 23265470, "text": "The increasing global trade of fishery and aquaculture products makes it necessary to develop methods for species identification in case of fish fillets or other highly processed seafood with external morphological characteristics (e.g. gills, fins) of the original fish being removed.

Early menopause and sterility are unintended consequences of chemotherapy, and efforts to understand the oocyte apoptotic pathway may provide new targets for mitigating this outcome. Recently, the c-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib) has become the focus of research as a fertoprotective drug against cisplatin. However, the mechanism by which imatinib protects oocytes is not fully understood, and reports of the drug's efficacy have been contradictory. Using in vitro culture and subrenal grafting of mouse ovaries, we demonstrated that imatinib inhibits the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of oocytes within primordial follicles. We found that, before apoptosis, cisplatin induces c-Abl and TAp73 expression in the oocyte. Oocytes undergoing apoptosis showed downregulation of TAp63 and upregulation of Bax. While imatinib was unable to block cisplatin-induced DNA damage and damage response, such as the upregulation of p53, imatinib inhibited the cisplatin-induced nuclear accumulation of c-Abl/TAp73 and the subsequent downregulation of TAp63 and upregulation of Bax, thereby abrogating oocyte cell death. Surprisingly, the conditional deletion of Trp63, but not \u0394Np63, in oocytes inhibited apoptosis, as well as the accumulation of c-Abl and TAp73 caused by cisplatin. These data suggest that TAp63 is the master regulator of cisplatin-induced oocyte death. The expression kinetics of TAp63, c-Abl and TAp73 suggest that cisplatin activates TAp63-dependent expression of c-Abl and TAp73 and, in turn, the activation of TAp73 by c-Abl-induced BAX expression. Our findings indicate that imatinib protects oocytes from cisplatin-induced cell death by inhibiting c-Abl kinase, which would otherwise activate TAp73-BAX-mediated apoptosis. Thus, imatinib and other c-Abl kinase inhibitors provide an intriguing new way to halt cisplatin-induced oocyte death in early follicles and perhaps conserve the endocrine function of the ovary against chemotherapy.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 19 April 2013; doi:10.1038/cdd.2013.31.", "anno": [[107, 108, true], [290, 291, true], [434, 435, true], [577, 578, true], [751, 752, true], [844, 845, true], [929, 930, true], [1230, 1231, true], [1394, 1395, true], [1483, 1484, true], [1683, 1684, true], [1859, 1860, true], [2075, 2076, true], [2173, 2174, true]]}, {"id": 23159885, "text": "The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily is composed of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)(+))-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids.

In addition to aldehyde metabolizing capacity, ALDHs have additional catalytic (e.g. esterase and reductase) and non-catalytic activities. The latter include functioning as structural elements in the eye (crystallins) and as binding molecules to endobiotics and xenobiotics. Mutations in human ALDH genes and subsequent inborn errors in aldehyde metabolism are the molecular basis of several diseases.

Such proteins often require a negative supercoiled DNA topology to function correctly. In current research, short linear DNA is often used to study DNA-protein interactions. Although linear DNA can easily be modified, for capture on a surface, its relaxed topology does not accurately resemble the natural situation in which DNA is generally negatively supercoiled. Moreover, specific binding sequences are flanked by large stretches of non-target sequence in vivo. Here, we present a straightforward method for capturing negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA on a streptavidin surface. It relies on the formation of a temporary parallel triplex, using a triple helix forming oligonucleotide containing locked nucleic acid nucleotides. All materials required for this method are commercially available. Lac repressor binding to its operator was used as model system. Although the dissociation constants for both the linear and plasmid-based operator are in the range of 4 nM, the association and dissociation rates of Lac repressor binding to the plasmid-based operator are \u223c18 times slower than on a linear fragment.
