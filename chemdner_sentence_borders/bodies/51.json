Tat substrates are produced with distinctive N-terminal signal peptides and are translocated as fully folded proteins. In Escherichia coli, Tat-dependent proteins often contain redox cofactors that must be loaded before translocation. Trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA) is a model bacterial Tat substrate and is a molybdenum cofactor-dependent enzyme. Co-ordination of cofactor loading and translocation of TorA is directed by the TorD protein, which is a cytoplasmic chaperone known to interact physically with the TorA signal peptide. In the present study, a pre-export TorAD complex has been characterized using biochemical and biophysical techniques, including SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering). A stable, cofactor-free TorAD complex was isolated, which revealed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. Surprisingly, a TorAD complex with similar architecture can be isolated in the complete absence of the 39-residue TorA signal peptide. The present study demonstrates that two high-affinity binding sites for TorD are present on TorA, and that a single TorD protein binds both of those simultaneously. Further characterization suggested that the C-terminal 'Domain IV' of TorA remained solvent-exposed in the cofactor-free pre-export TorAD complex. It is possible that correct folding of Domain IV upon cofactor loading is the trigger for TorD release and subsequent export of TorA.", "anno": [[116, 117, true], [235, 236, true], [351, 352, true], [473, 474, true], [658, 659, true], [823, 824, true], [919, 920, true], [1054, 1055, true], [1219, 1220, true], [1366, 1367, true], [1500, 1501, true]]}, {"id": 23399444, "text": "In a previous study we reported impaired swimming performance and greater stored energy in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) after chronic dietary exposure to selenomethionine (SeMet).

Fish were fed SeMet at measured concentrations of 1.3, 3.4, 9.8 or 27.5 \u03bcg Se/g dry mass (d.m.) for 90 d. At the end of the exposure period, fish from each treatment group were divided into three subgroups: (a) no swim, (b) swim, and (c) repeat swim. Fish from the no swim group were euthanized immediately at 90 d and whole body triglycerides, glycogen and lactate, and gene expression of energy metabolism and methionine catabolism enzymes were determined. Individual fish from the swim group were placed in a swim tunnel respirometer and swimming performance was assessed by determining the critical swimming speed (U(crit)). After both Ucrit and MO2 analyses, fish were euthanized and whole body energy stores and lactate were determined. Similarly, individual fish from the repeat swim group were subjected to two U(crit) tests (U(crit-1) and U(crit-2)) performed with a 60 min recovery period between tests, followed by determination of energy stores and lactate. Impaired swim performance was observed in fish fed SeMet at concentrations greater than 3 \u03bcg Se/g in the diet. However, within each dietary Se treatment group, no significant differences between single and repeat U(crits) were observed. Oxygen consumption, SMR and COT were significantly greater, and F-AS was significantly lesser, in fish fed SeMet. Whole body triglycerides were proportional to the concentration of SeMet in the diet. While swimming resulted in lesser concentrations of glycogen in the body, exposure to SeMet in the diet had no significant effect on glycogen content. Exposure to SeMet significantly down-regulated mRNA abundance of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) in muscle, and \u03b2-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HOAD), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP 1) and methionine adenosyltransferase 1 alpha (MAT 1A) in liver of adult zebrafish.

We have previously shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) downregulates E-cadherin and induces ovarian cancer cell invasion through the H(2)O(2)/p38 MAPK-mediated upregulation of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressor Snail. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the EGF-induced downregulation of E-cadherin are not fully understood. In the current study, we demonstrated that treatment of two ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV3 and OVCAR5, with EGF induced the expression of the transcription factor Egr-1, and this induction was abolished by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of the EGF receptor. EGF-induced Egr-1 expression required the activation of the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and was unrelated to EGF-induced H(2)O(2) production and activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Moreover, depletion of Egr-1 with siRNA abolished the EGF-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and increased cell invasion. Interestingly, siRNA depletion of Egr-1 attenuated the EGF-induced expression of Slug, but not that of Snail. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that Slug is a target gene of Egr-1. These results provide evidence that Egr-1 is a mediator that is involved in the EGF-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and increased cell invasion. Our results also demonstrate that EGF activates two independent signaling pathways, which are the H(2)O(2)/p38 MAPK-mediated upregulation of Snail expression and the Egr-1-mediated upregulation of Slug expression.

Furthermore, CaMKII inhibition in astrocytes is associated with the rapid onset of intracellular calcium oscillations. Surprisingly, this rapid calcium influx is blocked by the N-type calcium channel antagonist, omega-conotoxin. While the function of N-type calcium channels within astrocytes is controversial, these voltage-gated calcium channels have been linked to calcium-dependent vesicular gliotransmitter release. When extracellular glutamate and ATP levels are measured following CaMKII inhibition within our enriched astrocyte cultures, no alterations in glutamate levels are observed, whereas ATP levels in the extracellular environment significantly increase.

We found that exposure of melanoma cell lines with the BRAFV600E mutation to vemurafenib decreased the abundance of antiapoptotic proteins and induced intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis. Vemurafenib-treated melanoma cells showed increased cytosolic concentration of calcium, a potential trigger for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which can lead to apoptosis. Consistent with an ER stress-induced response, vemurafenib decreased the abundance of the ER chaperone protein glucose-regulated protein 78, increased the abundance of the spliced isoform of the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) (which transcriptionally activates genes involved in ER stress responses), increased the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 (which would be expected to inhibit protein synthesis), and induced the expression of ER stress-related genes. Knockdown of the ER stress response protein activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) significantly reduced vemurafenib-induced apoptosis.

Nevertheless, there has been a scarcity of empirical studies testing this assumption in alcohol literature. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of response inhibition and trait impulsiveness on cue-elicited craving for alcohol in alcohol-dependent drinkers. METHODS: Participants (n\u2009=\u200941) were inpatients of the private clinic U-Center, Netherlands. Alcohol exposure took place in a real bar-restaurant close to the premises of the clinic, and participants were exposed to real alcohol cues. Response inhibition was assessed with the stop-signal task and trait impulsiveness with the Barratt impulsivity scale version 11. RESULTS: The cue exposure was successful as alcohol-dependent patients experienced higher craving for alcohol when exposed to alcohol rather than to neutral cues. Additionally, both response inhibition and trait impulsiveness predicted cue-elicited craving for alcohol. Trait impulsiveness predicted both the absolute craving in the bar-restaurant and the increase in cue-elicited craving during the whole alcohol cue exposure, while response inhibition predicted only the former. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly implicate both trait impulsiveness and response inhibition in the modulation of cue-elicited craving in alcohol dependence.

STIM1 phosphorylation serves as an off-switch for SOCE. However, the signaling pathway for STIM1 phosphorylation is unknown. Here we show that SOCE activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); its effector p38\u03b2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38\u03b2 MAPK) phosphorylates STIM1, thus inhibiting SOCE in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (ECs). Activation of AMPK using AICAR resulted in STIM1 phosphorylation on serine residues and prevented PAR-1-induced Ca2+ entry. Further, AICAR pretreatment blocked PAR-1-induced increase in permeability of mouse-lung microvessels. Activation of SOCE with thrombin caused phosphorylation of isoform \u03b11, but not \u03b12 of the AMPK catalytic subunit. Moreover, knockdown of AMPK\u03b11 augmented SOCE induced by thrombin. Interestingly, SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK, blocked STIM1 phosphorylation and led to sustained STIM1-puncta formation and Ca2+ entry. Of the three p38 MAPK isoforms expressed in ECs, p38\u03b2 knockdown prevented PAR-1-mediated STIM1 phosphorylation and potentiated SOCE.

We also tested the hypothesis that liking would increase more when caffeine was paired with high energy density yogurt.

Radiotherapy is often used to treat early premalignant lesions regardless of ErbB2 status. Here, we show that clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation (IR)-induce cellular invasion of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells, as well as MCF10A cells overexpressing ErbB2. ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells, such as MCF7 and T47D, do not invade following treatment with IR nor do MCF10A cells overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor. ErbB2 becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine 877 in a dose- and time- dependent manner following exposure to X-rays, and activates downstream signaling cascades including PI3K/Akt. Inhibition of these pathways, as well as inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with antioxidants, prevents IR-induced invasion. Activation of ErbB2-dependent signaling results in upregulation of the forkhead family transcription factor, FoxM1, and its transcriptional targets, including matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Inhibition of FoxM1 by RNA interference prevented induction of invasion by IR, and overexpression of FoxM1 in MCF10A cells was sufficient to promote IR-induced invasion. Moreover, we found that 14-3-3\u03b6 is also upregulated by IR in cancer cells in a ROS-dependent manner, is required for IR-induced invasion in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells and together with FoxM1 is sufficient for invasion in ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells.

Conversely, exposure of primary cultured astrocytes and neurons to 20 mM ethanol for 3 days led to a transient PTP opening in astrocytes without affecting cell viability and to a permanent PTP opening in 10 to 20% neurons with the same percentage of cell death. Ethanol-treated mouse pups displayed a widespread caspase-3 activation in neurons but not in astrocytes and dramatic behavioral alterations. Interestingly, two different PTP inhibitors (namely, cyclosporin A and nortriptyline) prevented both ethanol-induced neuronal death in vivo and ethanol-induced behavioral modifications. We conclude that PTP opening is involved in ethanol-induced neurotoxicity in the mouse.", "anno": [[71, 72, true], [196, 197, true], [327, 328, true], [477, 478, true], [710, 711, true], [972, 973, true], [1113, 1114, true], [1299, 1300, true], [1387, 1388, true]]}, {"id": 23392120, "text": "Mesocrystals of Li-Mn-O compounds, such as LiMn2O4, Li2MnO3, and LiMnO2-Li2MnO3, consisting of oriented nanoscale units were selectively produced under hydrothermal conditions from biomimetically prepared MnCO3 mesocrystals.

It is not clear if there is a link between EMT and CSCs in thyroid cancers. We therefore investigated CSC properties of thyroid cancers that underwent EMT. Method: To induce EMT (spindle-like cell morphology, loss and acquisition of expression of an epithelial marker E-cadherin and a mesenchymal marker vimentin, respectively) in an epithelial type thyroid cancer cell line ACT-1, we used transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), BRAFV600E and/or Snail homolog 1 (SNAI1, also known as SNAIL) . CSC properties were analyzed with assays for cell proliferation, chemosensitivity, in vitro and in vivo tumor formation ability, cell surface antigens and intracellular aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH; a known CSC marker) activities. Results: EMT was induced most efficiently by SNAIL (ACT-SNAIL cells), whereas TGF-beta and BRAFV600E were less efficient. ACT-SNAIL cells showed slightly but significantly enhanced tumor formation ability in in vitro sphere assay (~3 fold) but not in vivo subcutaneous tumor growth assay, and showed comparable chemosensitivity, as compared to the parental ACT-1 cells. However, of interest, although in vitro sphere formation ability of ALDH+ cells was almost unchanged after SNAIL induction, SNAIL overexpression induced much higher (~14 fold) spheres in ALDH- cells. Thus, ALDH was no longer a CSC marker in ACT-SNAIL cells. Conclusions: All these data indicate that EMT confers CSC properties in ALDH- cells and appears to influence the ability of ALDH to enrich CSCs.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [192, 193, true], [268, 269, true], [348, 349, true], [356, 357, true], [690, 691, true], [921, 922, true], [930, 931, true], [1043, 1044, true], [1291, 1292, true], [1491, 1492, true], [1549, 1550, true], [1562, 1563, true], [1694, 1695, true]]}, {"id": 23374864, "text": "5-Nitropyrimidine analogs substituted with conformationally restricted azabicyclic amines and alcohols were prepared and evaluated their agonistic activity against human GPR119.

These subclones were established by stable transfection of K562/Dox cells with a plasmid vector expressing shRNA targeting the ABCB1 gene. Functional analysis of P-gp using a specific fluorescent probe indicated gradually decreased dye efflux which was proportional to the P-gp expression. We observed that K562/Dox cells overexpressing P-gp contained a significantly reduced intracellular level of nilotinib when compared to their counter partner K562 cells, which do not express P-gp. This effect was accompanied by a decreased sensitivity of the K562/Dox cells to nilotinib. Importantly, cells with downregulated expression of P-gp gradually lost their ability to decrease the intracellular level of nilotinib although they still significantly decreased the intracellular level of daunorubicin (DNR). Accordingly, cells with the reduced expression of P-gp concomitantly failed to provide resistance to nilotinib, however, they exhibited a significant resistance to DNR.
