Serum DBP level and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions 432 and 436 in the GC gene, encoding DBP, were examined. We confirmed self-reported ancestry using ancestry informative markers (AIMs), and included quantitative AIMs scores in the analysis. The multivariate model incorporated previously identified demographic and nutritional determinants of 25-OHD in this cohort, as well as GC SNPs and circulating DBP. Genetic variants in GC differed by self-reported ancestry. The 1f allele (D432/T436) was enriched in African Americans, occurring in 71%.

Using fMRI, we examined brain response to noncaloric versions of flavors that had been consumed in previous days with either 0 or 112.5 calories from undetected maltodextrin.

Inorganic polyphosphates are chains of orthophosphates linked by phosphoanhydride bonds that can be up to hundreds of orthophosphates in length. The role of polyphosphates in mammalian systems, where they are ubiquitous in cells, tissues and bodily fluids, and are at particularly high levels in osteoblasts, is not well understood. In cell-free systems, polyphosphates inhibit hydroxyapatite nucleation, crystal formation and growth, and solubility. In animal studies, polyphosphate injections inhibit induced ectopic calcification. While recent work has proposed an integrated view of polyphosphate function in bone, little experimental data for bone are available. Here we demonstrate in osteoblast cultures producing an abundant collagenous matrix that normally show robust mineralization, that two polyphosphates (PolyP5 and PolyP65, polyphosphates of 5 and 65 phosphate residues in length) are potent mineralization inhibitors. Twelve-day MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures with added ascorbic acid (for collagen matrix assembly) and \u03b2-glycerophosphate (a source of phosphate for mineralization) were treated with either PolyP5 or PolyP65. Von Kossa staining and calcium quantification revealed that mineralization was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by both polyphosphates, with complete mineralization inhibition at 10\u03bcM. Cell proliferation and collagen assembly were unaffected by polyphosphate treatment, indicating that polyphosphate inhibition of mineralization results not from cell and matrix effects but from direct inhibition of mineralization. This was confirmed by showing that PolyP5 and PolyP65 bound to synthetic hydroxyapatite in a concentration-dependent manner. Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP, ALPL) efficiently hydrolyzed the two PolyPs as measured by Pi release. Importantly, at the concentrations of polyphosphates used in this study which inhibited bone cell culture mineralization, the polyphosphates competitively saturated TNAP, thus potentially interfering with its ability to hydrolyze mineralization-inhibiting pyrophosphate (PPi) and mineralizing-promoting \u03b2-glycerophosphate (in cell culture). In the biological setting, polyphosphates may regulate mineralization by shielding the essential inhibitory substrate pyrophosphate from TNAP degradation, and in the same process, delay the release of phosphate from this source.

However, these oncogenes are also found in nevi, and it is now a well-accepted fact that their expression alone leads to senescence. This renders the understanding of senescence escape mechanisms an important point to understand tumor development. Here, we approached the question of senescence evasion by expressing the transcription factor v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-MYC), which is known to act synergistically with many oncogenes, in melanocytes. We observed that MYC drives the evasion of reactive-oxygen stress-induced melanocyte senescence, caused by activated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Conversely, MIZ1, the growth suppressing interaction partner of MYC, is involved in mediating melanocyte senescence. Both, MYC overexpression and Miz1 knockdown led to a strong reduction of endogenous reactive-oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and senescence. We identified the cystathionase (CTH) gene product as mediator of the ROS-related MYC and MIZ1 effects. Blocking CTH enzymatic activity in MYC-overexpressing and Miz1 knockdown cells increased intracellular stress and senescence. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of CTH in human melanoma cells also reconstituted senescence in the majority of cell lines, and CTH knockdown reduced tumorigenic effects such as proliferation, H(2)O(2) resistance and soft agar growth.

Our results showed that SUN induced the CYP1A1 mRNA, protein, and activity levels in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF7 cells. The increase in CYP1A1 mRNA by SUN was completely blocked by the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D; implying that SUN increased de novo RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the ability of SUN to increase luciferase reporter gene expression suggests an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent transcriptional control and excludes the possibility of any posttranscriptional mechanisms. In addition, blocking of AhR activation by resveratrol, a well-known AhR antagonist, prevented the SUN-induced CYP1A1 gene expression, further confirms the involvement of AhR.

However, although widely accepted, such an association is inconsistent with known labile allergens and resistant non-allergens. Given the central role of antigen presenting cells, and in particular dendritic cells (DCs), in the development of allergic responses, the stability of allergens to intracellular processing may be more relevant than resistance to extracellular pepsin digestion. We have characterised the expression by DC of cathepsins (proteolytic enzymes), and compared the proteolytic activity of the most highly expressed cathepsin with pepsin for a range of 9 allergens and 4 putative nonallergens. Cathepsin expression in bone marrow-derived DC (BM-DC) derived from BALB/c strain mice was characterised by flow cytometry; cathepsins D, E and S were identified, with cathepsin D being the most highly expressed. Digestion studies revealed that the majority of allergens (5/9) were pepsin resistant, whereas non-allergens (3/4) were labile. If the generation of pepsin-resistant fragments was considered as a feature of allergenicity, this increased to 7/9 allergens and 4/4 nonallergens. In contrast, most of the proteins examined were resistant to cathepsin digestion, with significant digestion recorded for only 2/9 allergens and 2/4 non-allergens. Chemical reduction (to mimic intracellular reducing conditions) increased the susceptibility of proteins to digestion by cathepsins, but did not improve discrimination between allergens and nonallergens on this basis. These data confirm that there is a general relationship between resistance to digestion with pepsin and allergenicity. The relationship is not absolute, but the information gained from this characteristic does provide useful information in a weight of evidence approach for allergenicity assessment. The most abundant cathepsin detected in antigen processing BM-DC, cathepsin D, is not an appropriate substitute for pepsin.

Separately measuring the cortical and trabecular FN compartments and combining the results would likely be a critical aspect of enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of a new technique. Because the cortical shell determines a large part of FN strength a novel quantitative ultrasound (QUS) technique that probes the FN cortical compartment was implemented. The sensitivity of the method to variations of FN cortical properties and FN strength was tested. Nine femurs (women, mean age 83 years) were subjected to QUS to measure the through transmission time-of-flight (TOF) at the FN and mechanical tests to assess strength. Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scans were performed to enable analysis of the dependence of TOF on bone parameters. DXA was also performed for reference. An ultrasound wave propagating circumferentially in the cortical shell was measured in all specimens. Its TOF was not influenced by the properties of the trabecular compartment. Averaged TOF for nine FN measurement positions/orientations was significantly correlated to strength (R2 \u2009=\u20090.79) and FN cortical QCT variables: total BMD (R(2) \u2009=\u20090.54); regional BMD in the inferoanterior (R2 \u2009=\u20090.90) and superoanterior (R2 \u2009=\u20090.57) quadrants; and moment of inertia (R2 \u2009=\u20090.71).

Therefore, high chemical conversion is central to observing this band gap in transport. We use an electrochemical approach involving phenyl-diazonium salts to systematically probe electronic modification in MLG and BLG with increasing functionalization for the first time, obtaining the highest conversion values to date. We find that both MLG and BLG retain their relatively high conductivity after functionalization even at high conversion, as mobility losses are offset by increases in carrier concentration. For MLG, we find that band gap opening as measured during transport is linearly increased with respect to the I(D)/I(G) ratio but remains below 0.1 meV in magnitude for SiO(2) supported graphene. The largest transport band gap obtained in a suspended, highly functionalized (I(D)/I(G) = 4.5) graphene is about 1 meV, lower than our theoretical predictions considering the quantum interference effect between two neighboring S-regions and attributed to its population with midgap states. On the other hand, heavily functionalized BLG (I(D)/I(G) = 1.8) still retains its signature dual-gated band gap opening due to electric-field symmetry breaking. We find a notable asymmetric deflection of the charge neutrality point (CNP) under positive bias which increases the apparent on/off current ratio by 50%, suggesting that synergy between symmetry breaking, disorder, and quantum interference may allow the observation of new transistor phenomena.

Hyperacetylation of transcription factors and nuclear cofactors regulating gene transcription in muscle wasting may influence muscle mass. In addition, hyperacetylation may render proteins susceptible to degradation by different mechanisms, including intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity exerted by HATs and by dissociation of proteins from cellular chaperones. In recent studies, inhibition of p300/HAT expression and activity and stimulation of SIRT1-dependent HDAC activity reduced glucocorticoid-induced catabolic response in skeletal muscle, providing further evidence that hyperacetylation plays a role in muscle wasting.

For example, muscle atrophy caused by denervation or immobilization may be associated with reduced, rather than increased, protein acetylation. In addition, whereas hyperacetylation results in increased degradation of certain proteins, other proteins may be stabilized by increased acetylation.

Data were compared to recently published normative reference data for young individuals. Backscattered electron imaging of the tumor region revealed a dense accumulation of mineralized tumor bone matrix (up to 90% of the medullar space). The BMDD was shifted tremendously towards higher matrix mineralization (CaMean +18.5%, CaPeak +22.5%, CaHigh +100 fold) compared to normal bone. Additionally the BMDD became much wider, indicating a higher heterogeneity in mineralization (CaWidth +40%). In contrast to lamellar bone, which mineralizes via a mineralization front, the mineralization of the tumor matrix starts by randomly distributed spots of mineral clusters fusing together to a highly mineralized non-lamellar bone matrix. We also found an altered BMDD of the patient's normal bone when compared with the reference BMDD of young individuals. In conclusion this high radiodensity region of the sclerosing sarcoma is not only due to the high amount of tumor matrix but also to its high mineralization density.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the roles of both genetic and non-genetic factors such as sex and non-shared environmental conditions that may mediate differential behavioral responses to lithium. METHODS: Mice were treated with lithium for 10\u00a0days and then tested in the forced swim test followed by lithium discontinuation and retesting to assess effects of lithium withdrawal. We also assessed effects of sex and cross-fostering on lithium response between the C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ strains, and antidepressant-like effects of lithium in the hybrid CB6F1/J strain that is derived from C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ parental strains. RESULTS: Neither sex nor maternal care significantly influenced the differential antidepressant-like response to lithium. Withdrawal from lithium treatment reversed antidepressant-like effects in the C57BL/6J strain but had no effects in BALB/cJ mice. Lithium treatment did not result in antidepressant-like effects in the CB6F1/J strain.

Although mouse is the best genetically engineered animal model to identify potential molecular targets for human diseases, only fragmentary information is available for basic mechanism of mouse prostate contraction. METHODS: Small smooth muscle tubular rings were excised from four mouse prostate lobes to measure their isometric contractions. High K(+) , noradrenaline (NA), or acetylcholine (ACh) was applied with and without various antagonists and/or inhibitors to examine the contractile signaling pathways. RESULTS: Maximum amplitude of agonist-induced contractions varied greatly with different lobes but not with different locations or orientations within each lobe. Both NA and ACh produced large contractions in ventral and dorsal rings, whereas only small contractions were elicited in lateral and anterior rings. Combination of alpha-1 and muscarinic antagonists suppressed K(+) depolarization-induced contraction potently in ventral rings, but slightly in anterior rings. Blocking of either Ca(2+) -release or Ca(2+) -influx reduced agonist-induced contraction of ventral rings, however, a considerable amount of contractility remained even with both blockers. Inhibitors of ROCK and PKC partially inhibited NA-induced contractions, whereas a combination of Ca(2+) -blockers and Ca(2+) -sensitization inhibitors strongly suppressed the contraction. CONCLUSIONS: The ejection of prostatic fluid is differentially regulated in each prostate lobe. In ventral prostate smooth muscle, Ca(2+) -release, Ca(2+) -influx, and ROCK- and PKC-mediated Ca(2+) -sensitizations are all involved in NA-induced contractions.

Herein, a general overview of biochemical composition, medical properties of these compounds, and characteristics of quality attributes of pepper fruits is presented.", "anno": [[83, 84, true], [173, 174, true], [356, 357, true], [520, 521, true], [764, 765, true], [931, 932, true]]}, {"id": 23322558, "text": "Perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) are ubiquitous, persistent chemical contaminants found in the environment, wildlife, and humans. Despite the widespread occurrence of PFCs, little is known about the impact these contaminants have on the health of wildlife populations. The authors investigated the relationship between PFCs (including \u2211perfluorocarboxylates, \u2211perfluoroalkyl sulfonates, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorodecanoic acid) and the clinocopathologic and immune parameters in a highly exposed population (n\u2009=\u200979) of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (mean \u2211PFCs\u2009=\u20091970\u2009ng/ml; range 574-8670\u2009ng/ml) sampled from 2003 to 2005 near Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Age-adjusted linear regression models showed statistically significant positive associations between exposure to one or more of the PFC totals and/or individual analytes and the following immunological parameters: absolute numbers of CD2+ T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, CD19+ immature B cells, CD21+ mature B cells, CD2/CD21 ratio, MHCII+ cells, B cell proliferation, serum IgG1, granulocytic, and monocytic phagocytosis. Several PFC analyte groups were also positively associated with serum alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, creatinine, phosphorus, amylase, and anion gap and negatively associated with cholesterol levels, creatinine phosphokinase, eosinophils, and monocytes. Based on these relationships, the authors suggest that the PFC concentrations found in Charleston dolphins may have effects on immune, hematopoietic, kidney, and liver function. The results contribute to the emerging data on PFC health effects in this first study to describe associations between PFCs and health parameters in dolphins.", "anno": [[127, 128, true], [266, 267, true], [695, 696, true], [1116, 1117, true], [1391, 1392, true], [1569, 1570, true], [1728, 1729, true]]}, {"id": 23289528, "text": "Amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) aggregation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Modulation of the self-assembly processes, therefore, is thought to be an attractive strategy for the prevention and treatment of AD. Interestingly, heme has been found to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation and even dismantle A\u03b2 aggregates. However, the mechanism remains unresolved. Recent research has shown that heme binds preferentially to the His(13) residue of A\u03b2 with the iron center, while the hydrophobic domain of A\u03b2 is also able to bind to heme. Herein, absorption spectrometric, Thioflavin T fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopic and transmission electron microscopic measurements revealed that the iron center is not required for the inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregation but do influence the binding affinity of heme toward A\u03b2 and the dismantlement rate and degree of the A\u03b2 aggregates. By studying the interaction of different truncated or mutated A\u03b2 peptides with heme or protoporphyrin, we further found that the porphyrin ring of heme is implicated to interact preferentially with the Phe(19) residue, facilitating the binding of heme to A\u03b2 and disturbing the interstrand aromatic interaction between the Phe residues, which is crucial for A\u03b2 fibrillation. These findings open new avenues in the understanding of the interaction between the heme and A\u03b2 and the pathways for modulation of A\u03b2 aggregation and disaggregation, which would be helpful in designing therapeutic strategies against AD.", "anno": [[89, 90, true], [223, 224, true], [318, 319, true], [361, 362, true], [534, 535, true], [882, 883, true], [1256, 1257, true], [1493, 1494, true]]}, {"id": 23265471, "text": "This study provides the first chemical investigation of wild-harvested fruits of Vanilla pompona ssp. grandiflora (Lindl.)

The method showed satisfactory linearity (r(2)>0.9969), precision (coefficient of variation <2%), recoveries (70-100%), limit of detection (0.008-0.212 \u03bcg/ml), and limit of quantification (0.027-0.707 \u03bcg/ml). The evaluation of crude and enzyme-hydrolyzed Soxhlet-extracted samples confirmed the leading role of glucosides in fruit development. LC-ESI-MS studies corroborated the identities of four glucosides and seven aglycones, among them vanillin (5.7/100 g), 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (3.6/100 g), and anisyl alcohol (7.1/100 g) were found in high concentrations.

For the bare reaction we have found two reaction mechanisms, involving proton coupled electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer processes that produce CH3SO3 and H2O. We also found a third reaction mechanism involving the double proton transfer process, where the products and reactants are identical. The computed rate constant for the oxidation process is 8.3 \u00d7 10(-15) cm(3) s(-1) molecule(-1). CH3SO3H forms two very stable complexes with water with computed binding energies of about 10 kcal mol(-1). The presence of a single water molecule makes the reaction between CH3SO3H and HO much more complex, introducing a new reaction that consists in the interchange of H2O between HO and CH3SO3H. Our kinetic calculations show that 99.5% of the reaction involves this interchange of the water molecule and, consequently, water vapor does not play any role in the oxidation reaction of methane sulfonic acid by the hydroxyl radical.", "anno": [[189, 190, true], [359, 360, true], [494, 495, true], [590, 591, true], [698, 699, true], [890, 891, true], [1125, 1126, true]]}, {"id": 23439479, "text": "The study objective was to investigate the potential of a beverage containing silymarin and l-arginine to alter basic physiological and urodynamic parameters in 22 normal healthy men aged 38-59years.
