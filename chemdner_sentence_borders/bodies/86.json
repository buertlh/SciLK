UV/ozone treatment offered a hydrophilic surface (water contact angle (\u03b8(water)) less than 10\u00b0), reflecting the formation of a surface oxide layer with the maximum thickness of ca. 1 nm and possibly the removal of surface contaminants. Upon immersion in a toluene solution of a RX, \u03b8(water) increased due to adsorption of the RX onto gallium substrates. In particular, UV/ozone-treated gallium substrates (UV-Ga) immersed in an ODPA solution exhibited \u03b8(water) close to 105\u00b0. The ellipsometric thickness of the adsorbed ODPA layer was ca. 2.4 nm, and CV data measured in an acetonitrile solution showed significant inhibition of redox reaction on the substrate surface. These results indicate the formation of a densely packed ODPA monolayer on UV-Ga. The coverage of a C17H35COOH layer adsorbed onto UV-Ga was lower, as shown by smaller \u03b8(water) (ca. 99\u00b0), smaller ellipsometric thickness (ca. 1.3 nm), and smaller electrode reaction inhibition. Adsorption of the other RX onto UV-Ga was weaker, as indicated by smaller \u03b8(water) (82\u00b0-92\u00b0). ODPA did not strongly adsorb onto UV-untreated gallium substrates, suggesting that the ODPA adsorption mainly originates from hydrogen bond interaction of a phosphonate group with surface oxide.

Cucurbitacins I and D showed a very strong cytotoxicity, which was higher than that of cytochalasin D, used as a drug reference. Almost 100% of the cells were apoptotic as observed by DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay) after 12 h with cucurbitacins I and D (1 \u03bcM) and cucurbitacin E (10 \u03bcM). In terms of IC(50) values, cucurbitacins I and E presented a higher toxicity compared to that of cucurbitacin D (MTT assay). Cucurbitacin E was readily hydrolyzed by human hepatic microsomes, leading to cucurbitacin I (K(m) 22 \u03bcM, V(max) 571 nmol/mg proteins/min). On the other hand, the three cucurbitacins were hydroxylated at a very low extent, but they were sulfated and glucuronidated.

STW 5 (Iberogast(\u00ae)), a combination of nine plant extracts, is widely used in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, including functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome for which the involvement of an inflammatory etiology is discussed. To investigate the possible anti-proliferative effects, STW 5 and its components have been tested by using the colon-carcinoma cell line HT-29. The analyses have been performed in comparison to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and diclofenac (Diclo), which are well-known to reduce colon carcinoma risk. RESULTS: STW 5 showed significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on HT-29 cancer cells, similar to NSAIDs under test. However, using the LDH assay, STW 5 revealed significantly lower cytotoxicity than Diclo at same concentrations. In contrast to NSAIDs, STW 5 induced COX-1/COX-2, caspase-3 and Bax mRNA expressions in HT-29 and blocked LPS mediated translocation of the NF-\u03baB p65 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. These effects might be relevant, e.g. for prevention of undesirable side effects like gastric erosions. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the pro-apoptotic effect of STW 5 on HT-29 cells is involving multiple targets and is possibly due to an activation of the caspase cascade via mitochondrial destabilization. Active concentrations of STW 5 are, in relation to therapeutic doses, comparable to those of ASA and Diclo, suggesting a similar favorable effect on colon carcinoma risk.", "anno": [[12, 13, true], [308, 309, true], [559, 560, true], [703, 704, true], [857, 858, true], [866, 867, true], [989, 990, true], [1102, 1103, true], [1329, 1330, true], [1433, 1434, true], [1445, 1446, true], [1641, 1642, true], [1812, 1813, true]]}, {"id": 23546602, "text": "The relationship between estrogen and some types of breast cancer has been clearly established.

We report an ER-dependent activation of some of the key steps of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway cascade that leads cells to improve some mechanisms that finally increase glucose uptake capacity. Our data suggest that both E2 and E2BSA enhance the entrance of the fluorescent glucose analogue 2-NBDG, and also activates s PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, leading to translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in an ER\u03b1 dependent manner.

We found that naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, but not chronic morphine administration, caused a strong induction of phospho-histone H3 immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell/core and in the lateral septum (LS), a change that was accompanied by augmented H3 acetylation (lys14) in neurons of the NAc shell. Morphine withdrawal induced the phosphorylation of the epigenetic factor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) in Ser421 both in the LS and the NAc shell. These epigenetic changes were accompanied by the activation of members of the ERK pathway as well as increased expression of the immediate early genes (IEG) c-fos and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1). Using a pharmacological approach, we found that H3 phosphorylation and IEG expression were partially dependent on ERK activation, while MeCP2 phosphorylation was fully ERK-independent.

This lack of consensus presents a constraint on the interpretation of CP29 optical spectra and their underlying electronic structure. To address this problem, we present new low-temperature (5 K) absorption, fluorescence, and hole-burned (HB) spectra for CP29 proteins from spinach, which are compared with the previously reported data. We focus on excitation energy transfer (EET) and the nature of the lowest-energy state(s). We argue that CP29 proteins previously studied by HB spectroscopy lacked at least one Chl a molecule (i.e., a615 or a611), which along with Chl a612 contribute to the lowest energy state in more intact CP29, and one Chl b (most likely b607). This is why the low-energy state and fluorescence maxima reported by Pieper et al. [Photochem. Photobiol. 2000, 71, 574] were blueshifted by ~ 1 nm, the low-energy state appeared to be highly localized on a single Chl a molecule, and the position of the low-energy state was independent of burning fluence. In contrast, the position of the nonresonant HB spectrum shifts blue with increasing fluence in intact CP29, as this state is strongly contributed to by several pigments (i.e., a611, a612, a615 and a610). Zero-phonon hole widths obtained for the Chl b band at 638.5 nm (5 K) revealed two independent Chl b \u2192 Chl a EET times, i.e., 4 \u00b1 0.5 ps and 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 ps. The latter value is a factor of two faster than previously observed by HB spectroscopy and very similar to the one observed by Gradinaru et al. [J. Phys. Chem.

Polymorphic variants in genes encoding apoptotic proteins, either from the extrinsic (FAS, TNF-\u03b1, CASP8) or the intrinsic (BAX, BCL2, CASP3, CASP9) pathways could be highly valuable in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Interestingly, the Arg72Pro SNP in TP53, the gene encoding tumor suppressor p53, was recently revealed a biomarker of poor prognosis in stroke due to its ability to modulate neuronal apoptotic death. Search for new SNPs responsible for genetic variability to apoptosis will ensure the implementation of novel diagnostic and prognostic tools, as well as therapeutic strategies against neurological diseases.", "anno": [[108, 109, true], [246, 247, true], [374, 375, true], [615, 616, true], [815, 816, true], [1022, 1023, true]]}, {"id": 23642079, "text": "Simulating droplet coalescence is challenging because small-scale (tens of nanometers) phenomena determine the behaviour of much larger (micron- to millimetre-scale) droplets. In general, liquid droplets colliding in a liquid medium coalesce when the capillary number is less than a critical value. We present simulations of droplet collisions and coalescence in simple shear flow using the free-energy binary-liquid lattice Boltzmann method. In previous simulations of low-speed collisions, droplets coalesced at unrealistically high capillary numbers. Simulations of non-coalescing droplets have not been reported, and therefore the critical capillary number for simulated collisions was unknown. By simulating droplets with radii up to 100 lattice nodes, we determine the critical capillary number for coalescence and quantify the effects of several numerical and geometric parameters. The simulations were performed with a well-resolved interface, a Reynolds number of one, and capillary numbers from 0.01 to 0.2. The ratio of the droplet radius and interface thickness has the greatest effect on the critical capillary number. As in experiments, the critical capillary number decreases with increasing droplet size. A second numerical parameter, the interface diffusivity (Peclet number) also influences the conditions for coalescence: coalescence occurs at higher capillary numbers with lower Peclet numbers (higher diffusivity). The effects of the vertical offset between the droplets and the confinement of the droplets were also studied. Physically reasonable results were obtained and provide insight into the conditions for coalescence. Simulations that match the conditions of experiments reported in the literature remain computationally impractical. However, the scale of the simulations is now sufficiently large that a comparison with experiments involving smaller droplets (~10 \u03bcm) and lower viscosities (10(-6) m(2)/s, the viscosity of water) may be possible.

This manuscript reports the results of an extensive study on the influence of molecular weight and architecture of a library of polylysine variants that includes linear, dendritic and hyperbranched polylysine. Hyperbranched polylysine is a new polylysine-based carrier that is structurally related to dendritic polylysine but possesses a randomly branched structure. Hyperbranched polylysine is attractive as it can be prepared in a one-step process on a large scale. The performance of these 3 classes of polylysine analogs was evaluated by assessing eGFP and IgG production in transient gene expression experiments with CHO DG44 cells, which revealed that protein production generally increased with increasing molecular weight and that at comparable molecular weight, the hyperbranched analogs were superior as compared to the dendritic and linear polylysines. To understand the differences between the gene delivery properties of the hyperbranched polylysine analogs on the one hand and the dendritic and linear polylysines on the other hand, the uptake and trafficking of the corresponding polyplexes were investigated. These experiments allowed us to identify (i) polyplex-external cell membrane binding, (ii) free, unbound polylysine coexisting with polyplexes as well as (iii) polymer buffer capacity as three possible factors that may contribute to the superior transfection properties of the hyperbranched polylysines as compared to their linear and dendritic analogs.

Furthermore, we found that knockdown of HDAC8 results in reduced expression of HoxA5 and consequently, attenuated ability of HoxA5 to activate p53 transcription, which can be rescued by ectopic expression of HoxA5. Because of the fact that HDAC8 is required for expression of both wild-type and mutant p53, we found that targeted disruption of HDAC8 expression remarkably triggers proliferative defect in cells with a mutant, but not wild-type, p53.

Little is known, however, about the effects of OT treatment on conditioned fear responding and extinction in humans. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of OT in a fear-potentiated startle task of fear conditioning and extinction. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 44 healthy human participants was conducted. Participants underwent a conditioned fear acquisition procedure, after which they were randomized to treatment group and delivered OT (24\u00a0IU) or placebo via intranasal (IN) spray. Forty-five minutes after treatment, participants underwent extinction training. Twenty-four hours later, subjects were tested for extinction recall. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, the OT group showed increased fear-potentiated startle responding during the earliest stage of extinction training relative to placebo; however, all treatment groups showed the same level of reduced responding by the end of extinction training. Twenty-four hours later, the OT group showed significantly higher recall of extinction relative to placebo.

The DAT is a principle target of various psychostimulant, nootropic and antidepressant drugs, as well as certain drugs used recreationally, including the notoriously addictive stimulant cocaine. DAT ligands have traditionally been divided into two categories: cocaine-like inhibitors and amphetamine-like substrates. Whereas inhibitors block monoamine uptake by the DAT, but are not translocated across the membrane, substrates are actively translocated and trigger DAT-mediated release of dopamine by reversal of the translocation cycle. As both inhibitors and substrates increase extraneuronal dopamine levels, it is often assumed that all DAT ligands posses an addictive liability equivalent to cocaine. However, the recent development of novel 'atypical' inhibitors and 'partial substrate' ligands with reduced or even a complete lack of cocaine-like rewarding effects suggests that addictiveness is not a constant property of DAT-affecting compounds. These atypical ligands do not conform to the classical preconception that all DAT inhibitors (or substrates) are functionally and mechanistically alike. Instead, they suggest the possibility that the DAT exhibits some of the ligand-specific 'pleiotropic' functional qualities inherent to G-protein-coupled receptors. That is, ligands with different chemical structures induce specific conformational changes in the transporter protein, which can be differentially transduced by the cell, ultimately eliciting unique behavioral and psychical effects.

However, supplementation of 7-oxysterols in cultured cells, secondary to cholesterol loading, preferentially slowed reduction of glucocorticoids, rather than oxidation. Thus, in mouse, 11\u03b2HSD1 influenced the abundance and balance of circulating and tissue levels of 7\u03b2OHC and 7KC, promoting reduction of 7KC.

In particular, it has yet to be clarified whether levothyroxine may fully overcome the detrimental effects of hypothyroidism or, conversely, whether affected women remain at reduced prognosis for pregnancy outcomes. Methods: Patients who underwent IVF-ICSI (IVF-intracytoplasmic sperm injection) over a three-year period were reviewed. Cases were deemed eligible if they were diagnosed with clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism and were receiving levothyroxine. Controls were two subsequently age-matched euthyroid women for every case. Both cases and controls were selected only if serum TSH was \u2264 2.5 mIU/L. Results: One hundred thirty-seven women with treated hypothyroidism and 274 controls were included. Baseline characteristics of the two study groups were similar with the exception of BMI, which was slightly higher among the cases (22.9 \u00b1 3.9 versus 21.9 \u00b1 3.3 Kg/m2, p=0.013). Most IVF-ICSI cycle outcome variables were also similar with the exception of a higher rate of cancellation for poor response (3.6% versus 0.7%, p=0.04), a longer duration of stimulation (10.9 \u00b1 2.2 versus 10.1 \u00b1 2.0 days, p=0.001), a higher proportion of women failing to obtain viable embryos (17% versus 7%, p=0.006), and a lower fertilization rate (75% versus 86%, p=0.017) among cases. Conversely, the clinical pregnancy rate per started cycle, the implantation rate and the live birth rate per started cycle did not differ; they were 36% and 34% (p=0.93), 28% and 22% (p=0.11) and 30% and 27% (p=0.50) in cases and controls, respectively. Subgroup analyses comparing women with (n=79) and without (n=58) thyroid autoimmunity and comparing women who were diagnosed with overt hypothyroidism (n=70) or subclinical hypothyroidism (n=67) failed to identify relevant differences. Conclusions: In our population, IVF-ICSI outcome was not significantly hampered in women with adequately treated hypothyroidism. The magnitude of the detected differences in cycle outcome was mild and we failed to document any differences for the most relevant outcomes, i.e. pregnancy rate, implantation rate and delivery rate.

Both intrinsic and acquired resistance results from the numerous genetic and epigenetic changes occurring in cancer cells. Most of the hallmarks of cancer cells provide general mechanisms to sustain stresses such as the ones induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, specific changes in the target bring resistance to specific drugs like modification in nucleotide synthesis enzymes upon anti-metabolite exposure, in microtubule composition upon spindle poison treatment, in topoisomerase activity upon topoisomerase inhibitor incubation or in intracellular signaling pathways when targeting tyrosine kinase receptors. Finally, the stemness properties of a few cancer cells as well as components of the tumor stroma, like fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages but also hypoxia, also help tumor to resist to anticancer agents. These processes provide an additional level of complexity to the understanding of the tumor resistance phenomenon. This review aims to describe the different general mechanisms as well as some examples of specific on target modifications inducing cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy at the molecular level.

To gain insight into gene expression signatures that can distinguish atopic dermatitis from non-atopic controls without skin biopsies, we undertook a comparative study of gene expression in FDKs from adult donors with atopic dermatitis and non-atopic donors. FDK primary cultures (atopic dermatitis, n = 11; non-atopic controls, n = 7) before and after interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) treatment were used for microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. Comparison of FDKs from atopic and non-atopic donors indicated that the former showed activated pathways with innate immunity and decreased pathways of cell growth, as indicated by increased NLRP2 expression and decreased DKK1 expression, respectively. Treatment with IFN-\u03b3 induced the enhanced expression of IL32, IL1B, IL8, and CXCL1 in the cells from atopic donors compared to that in cells from non-atopic donors at 24 h after treatment. IL1B expression in FDKs after IFN-\u03b3 treatment correlated with IL32 expression. We hypothesized that overexpression of IL32 in hair follicle keratinocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis would lead to the excessive production of pro-IL1\u03b2\uf020 and that the activation of IL1\u03b2 from pro-IL1\u03b2 by inflammasome complex, in which NLRP2 protein might be involved, would be augmented.

Mapping of rat striatal DAT phosphopeptides by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography revealed basal and PKC-stimulated phosphorylation of the same peptide fragments and comigration of PKC-stimulated phosphopeptide fragments with NDAT Ser-7 phosphopeptide markers. We further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry that Ser-7 is a site for PKC-stimulated phosphorylation in heterologously expressed rat and human DATs. Mutation of Ser-7 and nearby residues strongly reduced the affinity of rat DAT for the cocaine analog (-)-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane (CFT), whereas in rat striatal tissue, conditions that promote DAT phosphorylation caused increased CFT affinity. Ser-7 mutation also affected zinc modulation of CFT binding, with Ala and Asp substitutions inducing opposing effects.

In this article we investigate the effect of enzyme concentration on the morphology and properties of enzymatically triggered peptide hydrogels using HPLC, FTIR, real-time SAXS, TEM, and shear rheology. We have shown that the enzyme concentration, Cenz, does not affect the final composition of the samples. Instead, this is dictated by the initial tetrapeptide concentration, C0, suggesting the existence of a chemical equilibrium. We went on to show that Cenz does not affect the self-assembly of these peptides at a molecular level either nor the structure of the fibrillar network formed at the nanometer scale. Interestingly, the mechanical properties were found to be affected by Cenz, where the shear moduli of the hydrogels were found to increase with increasing Cenz. These results suggest that morphological differences between the hydrogels at the microscale are at the origin of their difference in mechanical properties. In this paper, we propose a morphological model in which denser network regions are found around the enzymes, resulting in the creation of heterogeneous networks. These were confirmed by TEM measurements.
