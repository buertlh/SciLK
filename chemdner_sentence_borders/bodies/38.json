Our study included 344 patients (104 men) with severe obesity (mean body mass index (BMI)= 45.7\u00b18.5 kg/m2), extensively evaluated clinically and biologically (complete metabolic tests, serum adiponectin and IGF-I measurements). Left ventricular mass index (LVMI), left atrium (LA) size and LV geometry were determined by means of cardiac ultrasound. Results. The most prevalent pattern of LV geometry was eccentric hypertrophy (28.7% of patients).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To test whether early life stress increases anxiety in mice, non-invasive tail cuff method was used to examine the autonomic nervous system activity by assessing cardiovascular reactivity and response to acute mixing stress (AMS) and restraint stress (RS) in adult mice subjected to early postnatal stress as compared to control. AMS-induced cardiovascular response was then evaluated in adult MS mice treated with Boophone disticha as compared to vehicle and diazepam. RESULTS: Comparisons of the BP and HR measurements indicated that MS significantly reduced AMS-induced HR responses in BALB/c mice when compared with control. Boophone disticha treatment significantly reduced AMS-induced BP response in BALB/c MS as compared to vehicle and diazepam treatments.

Sixty-five compounds with known in vivo teratogenicity (33 teratogens and 32 nonteratogens) were evaluated to develop a model for classifying compounds with teratogenic potential. The expression of 12 developmentally regulated gene targets (nanog, fgf5, gsc, cd34, axin2, apln, chst7, lhx1, fgf8, sox17, foxa2, and cxcr4) was measured following exposure of embryoid bodies to a single compound concentration (0.1 \u00d7 the cytotoxicity IC(20)) for 4 days. In the decision-tree model, compounds with IC(50) values < 22 \u00b5M were categorized as teratogens, whereas compounds in the two groups with IC(50) values between 22-200 \u00b5M and > 200 \u00b5M were categorized as teratogens if \u2265 8 and 12 genes, respectively, were deregulated by at least 10%. Forty-seven of 65 compounds of the training set were correctly identified (72% total concordance). In a test set of 12 additional compounds (5 teratogens, 7 nonteratogens), 10 were correctly classified by this approach (83% concordance).

Despite concerns with aquatic contaminations, relatively little information is available on the interaction in aquatic organisms. In the present study, the interactive effects of Se and Hg on their absorption, disposition, and elimination were examined in juvenile white sturgeon, a benthic fish species at high risk to exposures of both contaminants. Selenium and Hg were provided as L-selenomethionine (SeMet) and methylmercury (MeHg), respectively. Groups of 10 sturgeon were orally intubated with a single dose of either 0 (control), SeMet (500 \u03bcg Se/kg body weight; BW), MeHg (850 \u03bcg Hg/kg BW), or their combination (Se/Hg; 500 \u03bcg Se/kg and 850 \u03bcg Hg/kg BW).

The co-administration of SeMet and MeHg significantly (p<0.05) lowered blood concentrations of both Se and Hg and tissue Se concentrations. Similarly, assimilation of Se and Hg was also reduced significantly. The interaction has a more quantitative effect on Se metabolism because the reduction in the overall tissue Se is a consequence of reduced Se absorption at the gut and not from the metabolic effects after absorption. In contrast, given the pulse increase in blood Hg concentration, tissue redistribution, and increased urinary elimination, the interactive effect on tissue Hg concentration is likely to be post-absorption. Even in the absence of exogenous SeMet, Se and Hg co-accumulated in tissue at a Se:Hg molar ratio greater than 1. Thus, similar to mammals, maintaining at least a 1:1 molar ratio of Se and Hg is of great physiological importance in the white sturgeon. Interestingly, SeMet did not divert Hg from the brain. Allocation of Se from the kidneys may have occurred in order to maintain the high Se:Hg molar ratios in the brain of white sturgeon.

Finally, by chemical cross-linking of surface proteins in living cells and cell killing assay using a pore-forming bacterial toxin, we showed that enhanced oligomerization by GPI-remodeling occurs under a physiological membrane environment.

To facilitate such investigations, we have explored the utility of membrane tethered ligands (MTLs).

Rk/bursicon signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway in insects required for wing expansion, cuticle hardening, and melanization during development. We initially engineered two distinct MTL constructs, each composed of a type II transmembrane domain, a peptide linker, and a C terminal extracellular ligand that corresponded to either the \u03b1 or \u03b2 bursicon subunit. Coexpression of the two complementary bursicon MTLs triggered rk-mediated signaling in vitro. We were then able to generate functionally active bursicon MTLs in which the two subunits were fused into a single heterodimeric peptide, oriented as either \u03b1-\u03b2 or \u03b2-\u03b1. Carboxy-terminal deletion of 32 amino acids in the \u03b2-\u03b1 MTL construct resulted in loss of agonist activity. Coexpression of this construct with rk inhibited receptor-mediated signaling by soluble bursicon. We have thus generated membrane-anchored bursicon constructs that can activate or inhibit rk signaling. These probes can be used in future studies to explore the tissue and/or developmental stage-dependent effects of bursicon in the genetically tractable Drosophila model organism. In addition, our success in generating functionally diverse bursicon MTLs offers promise that such technology can be broadly applied to other complex ligands, including the family of mammalian cystine-knot proteins.", "anno": [[106, 107, true], [207, 208, true], [395, 396, true], [552, 553, true], [767, 768, true], [861, 862, true], [1030, 1031, true], [1137, 1138, true], [1235, 1236, true], [1339, 1340, true], [1517, 1518, true], [1733, 1734, true]]}, {"id": 23536314, "text": "Neurodegeneration is an important component of diabetic retinopathy with increasing evidence that retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death occurs early in diabetes.

To determine whether ChREBP is a potential therapeutic target, we decreased hepatic expression of ChREBP with a specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed either a high-fructose or high-fat diet. ChREBP ASO treatment decreased plasma triglyceride concentrations compared with control ASO treatment in both diet groups. The reduction was more pronounced in the fructose-fed group and attributed to decreased hepatic expression of ACC2, FAS, SCD1, and MTTP and a decrease in the rate of hepatic triglyceride secretion. This was associated with an increase in insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake, as assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

Several factors have been implicated in determining this toxicity, mainly individual genetic variation related to formation of active thiopurine metabolites. The aim was to identify genes involved in thiopurine-related myelosuppression. Materials & methods: A two-stage investigation of 19,217 coding SNPs (cSNPs) was performed in a Spanish (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group of Galicia [EIGA]) cohort of 173 IBD patients, 15 with bone marrow suppression. The top 20 cSNPs identified in the first stage with p < 10(-3) for allelic test association and SNPs that define the common TPMT alleles were replicated in a different Spanish (ENEIDA) cohort (87 patients, 29 with bone marrow suppression). Results: Several cSNPs showed a significant p-value in the allelic joint analysis (p-Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test \u22642.55 \u00d7 10(-3)) despite no cSNP passing correction for multiple testing in the first cohort.

A monotonic increase in the electrophoretic mobility (zeta potential) of the latex was observed, indicating a significant adsorption of fibrinogen on latex for all ionic strengths. No changes in the latex mobility were observed for prolonged time periods, suggesting the irreversibility of fibrinogen adsorption. The maximum coverage of fibrinogen on latex particles was precisely determined using the depletion method. The residual protein concentration after making contact with latex particles was determined by electrokinetic measurements and AFM imaging where the surface coverage of fibrinogen on mica was quantitatively determined. The maximum fibrinogen coverage increased monotonically with ionic strength from 1.8 mg m(-2) for 10(-3) M NaCl to 3.6 mg m(-2) for 0.15 M NaCl. The increase in the maximum coverage was interpreted in terms of the reduced electrostatic repulsion among adsorbed fibrinogen molecules. The experimental data agree with theoretical simulations made by assuming a 3D unoriented adsorption of fibrinogen. The stability of fibrinogen monolayers on latex was also determined in ionic strength cycling experiments. It was revealed that cyclic variations in NaCl concentration between 10(-3) and 0.15 M induced no changes in the latex electrophoretic mobility, suggesting that there were no irreversible molecule orientation changes in the monolayers.

Analysis of the relative contribution of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes indicated that Mn(2+)-induced mitochondrial H2O2 production required the presence of complex II substrate succinate. In contrast, complex I substrates malate and glutamate failed to support H2O2 production in the presence of Mn(2+). Furthermore, the succinate-supported Mn(2+)-induced mitochondrial H2O2 production was abolished by pharmacological inhibition of complex II but not that of complexes I and III, suggesting that mitochondrial complex II is a key mediator in Mn(2+)-induced H2O2 production.

Release from the gland of the reproductive hormones luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone is regulated primarily by hypothalamically-derived gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), although other releasing factors (RF) have been postulated to exist. Using a bioinformatic approach, we have identified a novel peptide, phoenixin, that regulates pituitary gonadotrophin secretion by modulating the expression of the GnRH receptor, an action with physiologically relevant consequences. Compromise of phoenixin in vivo using small interfering RNA resulted in the delayed appearance of oestrus and a reduction in GnRH receptor expression in the pituitary. Phoenixin may represent a new class of hypothalamically-derived pituitary priming factors that sensitise the pituitary to the action of other RFs, rather than directly stimulating the fusion of secretary vesicles to pituitary membranes.", "anno": [[61, 62, true], [326, 327, true], [559, 560, true], [727, 728, true], [964, 965, true]]}, {"id": 23624811, "text": "RATIONALE: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are a critical component of the cholinergic system of neurotransmission in the brain that modulates important physiological processes such as reward, cognition, and mood. Abnormalities in this system are accordingly implicated in multiple psychiatric illnesses, including addiction, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. There is significantly increased tobacco use, and therefore nicotine intake, in patient populations, and pharmacological agents that act on various nicotinic receptor subtypes ameliorate clinical features of these disorders. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cholinergic dysfunction in psychiatric disease will permit more targeted design of novel therapeutic agents. RESULTS: The objective of this review is to describe the multiple cellular pathways through which chronic nicotine exposure regulates nAChR expression, and to juxtapose these mechanisms with evidence for altered expression of high-affinity nAChRs in human psychiatric illness. Here, we summarize multiple studies from pre-clinical animal models to human in vivo imaging and post-mortem experiments demonstrating changes in nAChR regulation and expression in psychiatric illness. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a mechanistic explanation of nAChR abnormalities in psychiatric illness will arise from a fuller understanding of normal nAChR trafficking, along with the detailed study of human tissue, perhaps using novel biotechnological advances, such as induced pluripotent stem cells.", "anno": [[9, 10, true], [223, 224, true], [370, 371, true], [595, 596, true], [764, 765, true], [773, 774, true], [1041, 1042, true], [1243, 1244, true], [1256, 1257, true], [1547, 1548, true]]}]}
