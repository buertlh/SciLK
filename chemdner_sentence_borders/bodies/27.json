Using 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM Py3MeO-TBPo, flow cytometry studies demonstrated an increase of intracellular drug levels related to the incubation time, reaching a maximum at 18\u00a0h. LysoTracker(\u00ae) Green (LTG) and MitoTracker(\u00ae) Green (MTG) probes were used to identify the subcellular localization. Upon exposure to ultraviolet excitation, red porphycene fluorescence was detected as red granules in the cytoplasm that colocalized with LTG. No significant toxic effects were detected for Py3MeO-TBPo in the dark at concentrations below 1\u00a0\u03bcM. In contrast, Py3MeO-TBPo combined with red-light irradiation induced concentration- and fluence-dependent HeLa cells inactivation. Besides, all photodynamic protocols assayed induced a clear effect of cell detachment inhibition after trypsin treatment. Both apoptotic and necrotic cell death mechanisms can occur in HeLa cells depending on the experimental protocol. After 18\u00a0h incubation with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM Py3MeO-TBPo and subsequent red light irradiation (3.6\u00a0J/cm(2)), a high number of cells die by apoptosis, as evaluated by morphological alterations, immunofluorescent relocalization of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria, and TUNEL assay. Likewise, immunofluorescence techniques showed that cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into cytosol in cells undergoing apoptosis, which occurs immediately after relocation of Bax in mitochondria. The highest amount of apoptosis appeared 24\u00a0h after treatment (70%) and this cell death occurred without cell detachment to the substrate. In contrast, with 0.75\u00a0\u03bcM Py3MeO-TBPo and 3.6\u00a0J/cm(2) irradiation, morphological changes showed a preferential necrotic cell death. Singlet oxygen was identified as the cytotoxic agent involved in cell photoinactivation. Moreover, cell cultures pre-exposed to the singlet oxygen scavenger sodium azide showed pronounced protection against the loss of viability induced by Py3MeO-TBPo and light. Different changes in distribution and organization of cytoskeletal elements (microtubules and actin microfilaments) as well as the protein vinculin, after apoptotic and necrotic photodynamic treatments have been analyzed. Neither of these two cell death mechanisms (apoptosis or necrosis) induced cell detachment. In summary, Py3MeO-TBPo appears to meet the requirements for further scrutiny as a very good photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy: it is water soluble, has a high absorption in the red spectral region (where light penetration in tissue is higher), and is able to induce effective high apoptotic rate (70%) related to the more widely studied photosensitizers.", "anno": [[274, 275, true], [437, 438, true], [554, 555, true], [696, 697, true], [797, 798, true], [928, 929, true], [1050, 1051, true], [1164, 1165, true], [1433, 1434, true], [1638, 1639, true], [1777, 1778, true], [1909, 1910, true], [1998, 1999, true], [2172, 2173, true], [2394, 2395, true], [2486, 2487, true], [2849, 2850, true]]}, {"id": 23518040, "text": "There is an emerging literature describing the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of botulinum toxin.

Toxin that enters the body undergoes a distribution phase, which is quite short, and an elimination phase, which is comparatively long. During the distribution phase, botulinum toxin migrates to the peri-neuronal microcompartment in the vicinity of vulnerable cells, such as cholinergic nerve endings. Only these cells have the ability to selectively accumulate the molecule. When the toxin moves from the cell membrane to the cell interior, it undergoes programmed death. This is coincident with release of the catalytically active light chain that paralyzes transmission. Intraneuronal metabolism of light chain is via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Systemic metabolism and elimination is assumed to be via the liver.

The pathogenic process in the brain has, however, not been evaluated in detail due to the rarity of the neurological symptoms. However, copper accumulation is noted in LEC rat brain tissue from 24 weeks of age, which results in oxidative injuries. The current study investigated the gene expression profiles of LEC rat brains at 24 weeks of age in order to identify the important early molecular changes that underlie the development of neurological symptoms in WD. Biological ontology-based analysis revealed diverse altered expressions of the genes related to copper accumulation. Of particular interest, we found altered expression of genes connected to mitochondrial respiration (Sdhaf2 and Ndufb7), calcineurin-mediated cellular processes (Ppp3ca, Ppp3cb, and Camk2a), amyloid precursor protein (Anks1b and A2m) and alpha-synuclein (Snca). In addition to copper-related changes, compensatory upregulations of Cp and Hamp reflect iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Of note, reciprocal expression of Asmt and Bhmt is an important clue that altered S-adenosylhomocysteine metabolism underlies brain injury in WD, which is directly correlated to the decreased expression of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in hepatic tissue in LEC rats. In conclusion, our study indicates that diverse molecular changes, both variable and complex, underlie the development of neurological manifestations in WD.

Patients (n = 224) were randomized to AZD1656 (40-200, 20-140 or 10-80 mg titrated doses) or placebo.

RESULTS: HbA1c was reduced numerically from baseline by 0.3-0.8% with AZD1656 and by 0.1% with placebo over the first 2\u2009months of treatment, after which effects of AZD1656 started to decline.

Approximately 0.3% of the administered dose was taken up by the brain and was slowly eliminated, with a half-life of approximately 3 weeks. PQ did not alter the concentration of dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA) or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), or increase dopamine turnover in the striatum. There was inconsistent stereological evidence of a loss of DA neurons, as identified by chromogenic or fluorescent-tagged antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). There was no evidence that PQ induced neuronal degeneration in the SNpc or degenerating neuronal processes in the striatum, as indicated by the absence of uptake of silver stain or reduced immunolabeling of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive (TH(+)) neurons. There was no evidence of apoptotic cell death, which was evaluated using TUNEL or caspase 3 assays.

The number of TH(+) neurons in the SNpc was reduced, and there were increased numbers of degenerating neurons and neuronal processes in the SNpc and striatum. MPTP-mediated cell death was not attributed to apoptosis. MPTP activated microglia and astrocytes within 4h of the last dose, reaching a peak within 48h.

Male wistar rats were subjected to single intratracheal instillation of 2.5U/kg of bleomycin on day 0. Berberine treatments were either provided in preventive or therapeutic mode respectively. Berberine administration significantly ameliorated the bleomycin mediated histological alterations and reduced the inflammatory cell infiltrate in BALF. Berberine significantly blocked collagen accumulations with parallel reduction in the hydroxyproline level. The immunological sign of bleomycin stimulated mast cell deposition and histamine release were considerably reduced by berberine. Berberine enhanced the antioxidant status, through upregulating the redox sensing transcription factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Berberine inhibited the bleomycin mediated activation of inflammatory mediator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and suppressed its downstream target inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

Analysis of the genomic distribution of the significant GBS revealed a high prevalence of intragenic GBS. Gene ontology clusters involved in neuronal plasticity and other essential neuronal processes were overrepresented among the genes harboring a GBS or located in the vicinity of a GBS. Male adrenalectomized rats were challenged with increasing doses of the GR agonist corticosterone (CORT) ranging from 3 to 3000 \u03bcg/kg, resulting in clear differences in the GR-binding profile to individual GBS. Two groups of GBS could be distinguished: a low-CORT group that displayed GR binding across the full range of CORT concentrations, and a second high-CORT group that displayed significant GR binding only after administering the highest concentration of CORT. All validated GBS, in both the low-CORT and high-CORT groups, displayed mineralocorticoid receptor binding, which remained relatively constant from 30 \u03bcg/kg CORT upward. Motif analysis revealed that almost all GBS contained a glucocorticoid response element resembling the consensus motif in literature.

However, measuring agonist affinity in inactive receptors is confounded by concomitant activation. We identified a cysteine substituted mutant GABAA receptor with unique characteristics allowing determination of allosteric agonist site occupancy in both inactive and active receptors. Etomidate, the allosteric agonist, is an anesthetic that activates/modulates \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32L GABAA receptors via transmembrane sites near \u03b22M286 residues in M3 domains. Voltage-clamp electrophysiology studies of \u03b11\u03b22M286C\u03b32L receptors show that GABA is an efficacious agonist, and etomidate modulates GABA-activated activity, but direct etomidate agonism is absent. Quantitative analysis of mutant activity using an established Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) allosteric model indicates that the intrinsic efficacy of etomidate, defined as its relative affinity for active vs. inactive receptors, is lower than in wild-type receptors. Para-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS) covalently modifies \u03b22M286C sidechain sulfhydryls, irreversibly altering GABA-induced currents. Etomidate concentration-dependently reduces the apparent rate of \u03b22M286C-pCMBS bond formation, tracked electrophysiologically. High etomidate concentrations completely protect the \u03b22M286C suflhydryl from covalent modification, suggesting close steric interactions. The 50% protective etomidate concentration (PC50) is 14 \u03bcM in inactive receptors and 1.1 to 2.2 \u03bcM during GABA-activation, experimentally demonstrating that activated receptors bind etomidate more avidly than inactive receptors.

The complexity of Cdk1 regulation has made it difficult to determine whether these different roles require different thresholds of kinase activity and whether the surge of activity as inhibitory phosphates are removed at mitotic onset is essential for cell proliferation. Here, we have used chemical genetics in a human cell line to address these issues. We rescued cells lethally depleted of endogenous Cdk1 with an exogenous Cdk1 conferring sensitivity to one ATP analogue inhibitor (1NMPP1) and resistance to another (RO3306). At no 1NMPP1 concentration was mitosis in rescued clones prevented without also inducing endoreduplication, suggesting that these two key roles for Cdk1 are not simply controlled by different Cdk1 activity thresholds. We also rescued RO3306-resistant clones using exogenous Cdk1 without inhibitory phosphorylation sites, indicating that the mitotic surge of Cdk1 activity is dispensable for cell proliferation. These results suggest that the basic mammalian cycle requires at least some qualitative changes in Cdk1 activity and that quantitative increases in activity need not be rapid.

To assess the involvement of copper in PCB toxicity, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an AIN-93G diet with differing dietary copper levels: low (2 ppm), adequate (6 ppm), and high (10 ppm).

Two weeks following injections, biochemical and morphological markers of hepatic toxicity, trace metal status, and hepatic gene expression of metalloproteins were evaluated. Increasing dietary copper was associated with elevated tissue levels of copper and ceruloplasmin. In the livers of PCB126-treated rats, the hallmark signs of AhR activation were present, including increased cytochrome P450 and lipid levels and decreased glutathione. In addition, a doubling of hepatic copper levels was seen, and overall metal homeostasis was disturbed, resulting in decreased hepatic selenium, manganese, zinc, and iron. Expression of key metalloproteins was either decreased (cytochrome c oxidase), unchanged (ceruloplasmin and CuZnSOD), or increased (tyrosinase and metallothioneins 1 and 2) with exposure to PCB126. Increases in metallothionein may contribute/reflect the increased copper seen. Alterations in dietary copper did not amplify or abrogate the hepatic toxicity of PCB126.

Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of DDR1 binding to type I collagen, preserving the engagement of the other collagen receptors, GPVI, alpha2beta1 and LAIR-1 determines a decrease in MK migration due to the reduction in SHP1 phosphatase activity and consequent increase in the phosphorylation level of its main substrate Syk. Consistently, inhibition of Syk activity restored MK migration on type I collagen.

Quantum dot/metal oxide bilayers form the most efficient colloidal quantum dot solar cells, and most studies have advanced the understanding of the quantum dot component. We study the interfacial recombination process in depleted heterojunction colloidal quantum dot (QD) solar cells formed with ZnO as the oxide by varying (i) the carrier concentration of the ZnO layer and (ii) the density of intragap recombination sites in the QD layer. We find that the open-circuit voltage and efficiency of PbS QD/ZnO devices can be improved by 50% upon doping of the ZnO with nitrogen to reduce its carrier concentration. In contrast, doping the ZnO did not change the performance of PbSe QD/ZnO solar cells. We use X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, transient photovoltage decay measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and intensity-dependent photocurrent measurements to investigate the origin of this effect. We find a significant density of intragap states within the band gap of the PbS quantum dots. These states facilitate recombination at the PbS/ZnO interface, which can be suppressed by reducing the density of occupied states in the ZnO. For the PbSe QD/ZnO solar cells, where fewer intragap states are observed in the quantum dots, the interfacial recombination channel does not limit device performance.
