The experimental approaches involve integrating apixaban elimination pathways with pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from bile duct-cannulated (BDC) rats and dogs receiving i.v. doses together with oral administration of activated charcoal (AC). Additionally, the role of P-gp (P-glycoprotein; abcb1) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein; abcg2) in apixaban disposition was evaluated in experiments using transporter inhibitors and transporter knockout (KO) rats. Approximately 20-50% of an apixaban i.v. dose was found in feces of BDC rats and dogs, suggesting IE leading to fecal elimination and intestinal clearance (IC). The fecal elimination, IC, and systemic clearance of apixaban were increased upon AC administration in both BDC rats and dogs and were decreased in BDC rats dosed with GF-120918, a dual BCRP and P-gp inhibitor). BCRP appeared to play a more important role for absorption and intestinal and renal elimination of apixaban than P-gp in transporter-KO rats after oral and i.v. dosing, which led to a higher level of active renal excretion in rat than other species. These data demonstrate that apixaban undergoes IE, EER, and RTR that are facilitated by efflux transporters. Intestinal reabsorption of apixaban could be interrupted by AC even at 3 hours post-drug dose in dogs (late charcoal effect).

BWA is a naturally occurring or human-modified form that may kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war or terrorism. BWA is a weapon of choice for mass destruction and terrorism, because of the incubation period, less effective amount than chemical warfare agents, easily distribution, odorless, colorless, difficult to detect, no need of specialized equipment for production and naturally distribution which can easily be obtained. BWA may be disseminating as an aerosol, spray, explosive device, and by food or water. CLASSIFICATION: Based on the risk for human health, BWAs have been prioritized into three categories of A, B and C. Category A includes microorganisms or toxins that easily spread, leading to intoxication with high death rates such as Anthrax, Botulism, Plague, Smallpox, Tularemia and Viral hemorrhagic fevers. Category B has lower toxicity with wider range, including Staphylococcal Entrotoxin type B (SEB), Epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens, Ricin, Saxotoxins, Abrin and Trichothecene mycotoxins. The C category includes emerging pathogens that could also be engineered for mass spread such as Hanta viruses, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, Nipah virus, the tick-borne encephalitis viruses, hemorrhagic fever viruses and yellow fever. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF BIOTOXINS IN HUMAN: Clinical features and severity of intoxication depend on the agent and exposed dose, route of entry, individual variation and environmental factors. Onset of symptoms varies from 2-24\u00a0h in Ricin to 24-96\u00a0h in Botulism. Clinical manifestations also vary from irritation of the eyes, skin and mucus membranes in T(2) toxin to an acute flaccid paralysis of bilateral cranial nerve impairment of descending manner in botulism. Most of the pyrogenic toxins such as SEB produce the same signs and symptoms as toxic shock syndrome including a rapid drop in blood pressure, elevated temperature, and multiple organ failure. MANAGEMENT: There is no specific antidote or effective treatment for most of the biotoxins. The clinical management is thus more supportive and symptomatic. Fortunately vaccines are now available for most of BWA. Therefore, immunization of personnel at risk of exposure is recommended. CONCLUSION: Biotoxins are very wide and bioterrorism is a heath and security threat that may induce national and international problems.

This calcification increase was also observed in the aortas of a vascular calcification model: 5/6 nephrectomized rats fed with a high Pi diet and treated with vitamin D(3). Several known mechanisms that might explain arsenic toxicity in our experimental model were discarded: apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammasome activation. Nevertheless, both senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity and p21 expression were increased by As(III), which reveals the induction of SIPS. As(III) also caused dedifferentiation of VSMC, as shown by the reduced expression of the VSMC markers SM22\u03b1 and calponin. Senescence and gene expression were also observed in the aortas of healthy rats treated with 50 ppm As(V) in drinking water for 1 month.

The oxidized proteins were also characterized by significant oxidation of Met, Trp, and Tyr (but not other) residues, and low levels of dityrosine.

Using patch-clamp analysis, we demonstrated that K(+)in currents of pollen tube protoplasts were inhibited by elevated [Ca(2+)]cyt. However, disruption of CPK11 or CPK24 completely impaired the Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of K(+)in currents and enhanced pollen tube growth. Moreover, the cpk11 cpk24 double mutant exhibited similar phenotypes as the corresponding single mutants, suggesting that these two CDPKs function in the same signaling pathway. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that CPK11 could interact with CPK24 in vivo. Furthermore, CPK11 phosphorylated the N terminus of CPK24 in vitro, suggesting that these two CDPKs work together as part of a kinase cascade. Electrophysiological assays demonstrated that the Shaker pollen K(+)in channel is the main contributor to pollen tube K(+)in currents and acts as the downstream target of the CPK11-CPK24 pathway.

Since metabolic derangements found in metabolic syndrome, such as high serum levels of glucose, insulin and free fatty acids (FFAs), are major risk factors promoting atherosclerosis, we investigated whether PLIN3 expression is affected by glucose, insulin and oleic acid (OA) using RAW264.7 cells. METHODS: Real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect PLIN3 or PLIN2 expression. Oil-red O staining and Lipid Analysis were employed to measure cellular content of triacylglycerides (TAG) and cholesterol. RESULTS: PLIN3 mRNA was stimulated by high glucose or insulin concentrations individually, but not by OA. A combination of any two factors did not enhance PLIN3 expression any more than that evoked by glucose alone at 24h. Interestingly, however, simultaneous addition of all three factors synergistically enhanced the PLIN3 expression. This synergistic effect was not apparent for PLIN2 mRNA expression. Inhibitors of Src family tyrosine kinase and/or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, both of which are activated by insulin and FFA signaling, partially suppressed PLIN3 expression induced by the combination of the three factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant ethanolic extracts were initially tested against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in human U937 monocytes. The effect of the plant extracts on the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway was evaluated in TNF-\u03b1 stimulated HepG2 cells by luciferase gene reporter assay and Western blotting at the transcriptional and translational levels. Subsequently, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB downstream gene expression (IL-8 and ICAM-1) by the plant extracts was assessed via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Lastly, the anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts in vivo were evaluated by testing spleen index and NF-\u03baB related protein expression in LPS-stimulated CD1 mice. RESULTS: The plant ethanolic extracts effectively suppressed PGE2, IL-6 and TNF release with an IC50 less than 50\u03bcg/ml. Moreover, luciferase expression could be specifically blocked in HepG2 cells, not in HEK293 cells, showing that the plant extracts displayed a cell-specific pattern on NF-\u03baB gene transcription. The assayed biological activity also depended on the order of adding TNF-\u03b1 and the plant extracts because the plant extracts could only block the NF-\u03baB activation if added earlier but were unable to stop the signal when added after TNF-\u03b1. However, the plant extracts did not exert any effect on ubiquitination which regulates several steps in the NF-\u03baB pathway. Additionally, the plant extracts down-regulated phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 at S176/180, p38 at T180/Y182 and p65 at S536, but not p65 at S276.

Intraperitoneal injection of CO-releasing molecule 2 (CORM2) into mice with reduced bone mass due to ovariectomy (OVX) resulted in significantly elevated bone mass. Increased serum levels of collagen-type I fragments, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to OVX were also decreased when treated with CORM2. In vitro, CORM2 inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced OC formation without affecting bone resorption. CORM2 reduced long-lasting ROS levels and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation in response to RANKL. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase partially reduced the inhibitory effect of CO. CO induced increase of peroxiredoxin 1 (PRX1) in BMM. Down-regulation of PRX1 reduced the inhibitory effect of CO on OC formation and sustained the ROS levels induced by RANKL, suggesting that CO reduces generation of ROS and scavenges ROS to inhibit osteoclastogenesis. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of CO on osteoclastogenesis is caused by impaired RANKL signaling through defective NF-\u03baB activation and reduced levels of long-lasting ROS.

In this work, we have used neutron reflection and surface pressure measurements to study the reaction of the ubiquitous pollutant gas-phase ozone, O3, with pure and mixed phospholipid monolayers at the air-water interface. The results reveal that the reaction of the unsaturated lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC, with ozone leads to the rapid loss of the terminal C9 portion of the oleoyl strand of POPC from the air-water interface. The loss of the C9 portion from the interface is accompanied by an increase in the surface pressure (decrease in surface tension) of the film at the air-water interface. The results suggest that the portion of the oxidized oleoyl strand that is still attached to the lipid headgroup rapidly reverses its orientation and penetrates the air-water interface alongside the original headgroup, thus increasing the surface pressure. The reaction of POPC with ozone also leads to a loss of material from the palmitoyl strand, but the loss of palmitoyl material occurs after the loss of the terminal C9 portion from the oleoyl strand of the molecule, suggesting that the palmitoyl material is lost in a secondary reaction step. Further experiments studying the reaction of mixed monolayers composed of unsaturated lipid POPC and saturated lipid dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DPPC, revealed that no loss of DPPC from the air-water interface occurs, eliminating the possibility that a reactive species such as an OH radical is formed and is able to attack nearby lipid chains.

Experimental results showed that the optimum conditions for decolourization were pH 3.0, Fe(0) 1g/L, H(2)O(2) 5.15\u00d710(-3)mol/L with ultrasound density of 120W/L at 60kHz. These conditions yielded 99% decolouration of 4.7\u00d710(-5) M DB15 (4130 ADMI) solution within 10min. DB15 decolouration follows the first-order decolouration kinetics. Although the solutions containing H(2)CO(3), Cl(-), ClO(4)(-), NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-) ions did not have a significant effect on the decolouration, the H(2)PO(4)(-) ion did decrease the decolouration rate. High ultrasonic input power accelerated the reaction and increased decolourization efficiency. The cost effectiveness of this process at high ultrasound density could be controlled despite the high electricity costs incurred by the process. ZVI aggregates were reusable; however, an increase in the number of times ZVI was recycled decreased the decolourization rate. This study demonstrates that a Fenton/US process can effectively decolour the direct azo dye DB15 in wastewater.", "anno": [[152, 153, true], [213, 214, true], [316, 317, true], [487, 488, true], [586, 587, true], [653, 654, true], [858, 859, true], [953, 954, true], [1099, 1100, true], [1226, 1227, true], [1339, 1340, true]]}, {"id": 23150983, "text": "A series of 2-(substituted phenyl/benzyl-amino)-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(methoxycarbonyl)-4-methyl-3,6-dihydropyrimidin-1-ium chlorides 7-13 and 15 was synthesized in their hydrochloride salt form.
