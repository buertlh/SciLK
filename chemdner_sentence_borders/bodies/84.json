The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that in the brain, regulates several important physiological functions such as neuronal development and synaptic plasticity, and also seems to be involved in many pathologies, including epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. Previous work in animal models of both genetic and acquired generalized convulsive epilepsies, has suggested that modulators of the mTOR signaling pathway may have beneficial neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic effects. Here, we investigated for the first time, the effect of some treatment schedules (i.e. early chronic, sub-chronic and acute) with the specific mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, on the development of absence seizures and seizure parameters as well as depressive-like behavior in WAG/Rij rats, a genetic model of absence epilepsy, epileptogenesis and mild-depression comorbidity. In addition, we studied the possible interaction between rapamycin treatment and the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin administration, which is known to aggravate absence seizures through generation of increased neuroinflammatory responses. We found that rapamycin (early chronic treatment for 17 weeks, starting at P45) exhibited clear antiepileptogenic properties also in this animal epilepsy model; however, this effect was accompanied by unexpected prodepressant effects. Both acute and sub-chronic (7 day) treatments also had anti-absence properties, but the sub-chronic treatment produced contrasting antidepressant properties in the WAG/Rij rats that were not seen in control Wistar rats. The rapamycin/LPS co-administration studies showed that rapamycin blocked or prevented the LPS-dependent increase in absence seizures, suggesting an anti-inflammatory-like protective action. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a novel antiepileptogenic effect of rapamycin in a well-established animal model of absence epilepsy, and we suggest that this effect may be mediated by the inhibition of inflammatory processes that are developed in the brain of these specific animals during epileptogenesis and during seizures.

Automated routines were developed to convert micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images of femora into micro-finite element (micro-FE) models. The method was experimentally validated on femora from C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice: for both inbred strains the micro-FE models closely matched the experimentally measured bone stiffness when using a single tissue modulus of 13.06GPa.

Confocal and electron microscopic analysis clearly demonstrated that all three types of quantum dots could cross the intestinal epithelial barrier and be translocated to other cells.

In this study, the inducibility of these enzymes and monohydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3 ) were evaluated after exposure to P450-inducing drugs. With human hepatocytes, treatment with phenobarbital, hyperforin, carbamazepine, and rifampin significantly increased the levels of CYP3A4, but not CYP24A1 or CYP27B1 mRNA.

Subsequently, several isoforms were found to be associated with the inhibitory effects of lipid over-supply on glucose homeostasis, especially the negative cross-talk with insulin signal transduction, observed upon accumulation of diacylglycerol in insulin target tissues. The PKC family has therefore attracted much attention in diabetes and obesity research, because intracellular lipid accumulation is strongly correlated with defective insulin action and the development of type\u00a02 diabetes. Causal roles for various isoforms in the generation of insulin resistance have more recently been confirmed using PKC-deficient mice. However, during characterization of these animals, it became increasingly evident that the enzymes play key roles in the modulation of lipid metabolism itself, and may control the supply of lipids between tissues such as adipose and liver. Molecular studies have also demonstrated roles for PKC isoforms in several aspects of lipid metabolism, such as adipocyte differentiation and hepatic lipogenesis. While the precise mechanisms involved, especially the identities of protein substrates, are still unclear, the emerging picture suggests that the currently held view of the contribution of PKC isoforms to metabolism is an over-simplification.

By contrast, the editing of some sites is completely lost or significantly reduced in other non-green tissues; for instance, the editing of ndhB-149, ndhB-1255, and ndhD-2 is completely lost in roots and in lincomycin-treated seedlings. The editing of ndhD-2 is also completely lost in albino mutants and norflurazon-treated seedlings. However, matK-640 is completely edited, and accD-794, atpF-92, psbE-214, psbF-77, psbZ-50, and rps14-50 are completely or highly edited in both green and non-green tissues. In addition, the expression of nucleus-encoded RNA polymerase dependent transcripts is specifically induced by lincomycin, and the splicing of ndhB transcripts is significantly reduced in the albino mutants and inhibitor-treated seedlings.

This concept was demonstrated by incorporating a fluorescently labeled furan-RGDS sequence into a hydrogel possessing excess maleimide functionalities and monitoring the subsequent liberation of RGDS at various temperatures, illustrating a Diels-Alder mediated release mechanism. The release profile was quantified at temperatures ranging from physiological (37 \u00b0C) to 80 \u00b0C.

In addition to thermal modulation, tuning of the release rate was accomplished by altering the number of possible Diels-Alder tethering sites present in the hydrogel.

Herein, drug delivery carriers such as PEI-PLGA nanoparticles (PEI-NPs) and acetylated PEI-PLGA nanoparticles (AcPEI-NPs) were utilized to examine the effect of acetylation on NPs biocompatibility and genotoxicity, using human primary cells as in vitro model. Cell uptake of NPs was characterized along with their effects on cellular viability. The results indicate that both NPs showed an equivalent behavior in terms of uptake and biocompatibility. In depth analysis of NP uptake on cell biology evidenced that these nanoparticles induced dose dependant genotoxic effects. This phenomenon was significantly reduced by PEI acetylation. Endocytosed PEI-NPs trigger an oxidative stress on cells by inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause DNA damage without apparently affecting cell viability. Thus, the genotoxicity of nanoparticles, that could be used as non-viral drug carriers, should be evaluated based on the intracellular level of ROS generation and DNA damage even in absence of a significant cell death.", "anno": [[170, 171, true], [370, 371, true], [630, 631, true], [715, 716, true], [821, 822, true], [945, 946, true], [1007, 1008, true], [1193, 1194, true], [1412, 1413, true]]}, {"id": 23091170, "text": "Diisocyanates are an important cause of chemical-induced occupational asthma. This type of immunologically mediated asthma is often characterized by a predominant granulocytic inflammation in the airways, rather than an infiltration by lymphocytes. We sought to determine the contribution of granulocytes in the outcome of chemical-induced asthma using general and specific leukocyte depletion strategies in an established mouse model of isocyanate asthma. On days 1 and 8, BALB/c mice received dermal applications with toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) or vehicle (acetone olive oil), followed by two ip injections of cyclophosphamide (CP, days 11 and 13), or one iv injection of antigranulocyte receptor 1 (aGR1, day 13) monoclonal antibody (mAb), or two ip injections of Ly6G-specific mAb (1A8, days 13 and 14). On day 15, the mice were challenged (oropharyngeal administration) with TDI or vehicle. The next day, we assessed methacholine airway hyperreactivity (AHR); bronchoalveolar lavage differential cell count; histopathology and total serum IgE; and auricular lymphocyte subpopulations and release of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and gamma interferon by these lymphocytes. CP depleted all leukocyte types and completely prevented AHR and airway inflammation. aGR1 depleted granulocytes and CD8(+) lymphocytes, which resulted in a partial prevention in AHR but no decrease in airway inflammation. Depletion of Ly6G-positive granulocytes, i.e., both neutrophils and eosinophils, prevented AHR and lung epithelial damage and significantly reduced airway inflammation. Injection of aGR1 or 1A8 led to significantly changed cytokine release patterns in TDI-treated mice.

Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are antiretrovirals known to induce mitochondrial damage in endothelial cells, culminating in endothelial dysfunction, an initiating event in atherogenesis. Though the mechanism for NRTI-induced endothelial toxicity is not yet clear, our prior work suggested that a mitochondrial oxidative stress may be involved. To further delineate the mechanism of toxicity, endothelial cells were treated with NRTI of varying subclasses, and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial function were assessed. To test whether rescue of mitochondrial electron transport attenuated NRTI-induced endothelial dysfunction, in some cases, cells were co-treated with the electron transport cofactor coenzyme Q10 (Q10). At 4-6h, NRTI increased levels of ROS but decreased the activities of electron transport chain complexes I-IV, levels of ATP and the NAD/NADH ratio. Moreover, nitric oxide levels were decreased, while endothelin-1 release was increased. Q10 abolished NRTI-induced mitochondria injury and effects on endothelial agonist production. Interestingly, in cells treated with NRTI only, markers for mitochondrial toxicity returned to baseline levels by 18-24h, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for clearing damaged mitochondria. Using confocal microscopy, with confirmation utilizing the autophagy and mitophagy markers LC-3 and NIX, respectively, we observed autophagy of mitochondria at 8-10 h after treatment. Q10 prevented NRTI-mediated increase in LC-3. These findings suggest that NRTI-induced mitophagy may be involved in NRTI-induced endothelial dysfunction and that this damage likely results from oxidant injury. Further, Q10 supplementation could potentially prevent NRTI-induced endothelial dysfunction.", "anno": [[123, 124, true], [331, 332, true], [488, 489, true], [689, 690, true], [891, 892, true], [1040, 1041, true], [1128, 1129, true], [1222, 1223, true], [1415, 1416, true], [1599, 1600, true], [1645, 1646, true], [1809, 1810, true], [1902, 1903, true]]}, {"id": 23372041, "text": "Dietary intake of macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) has been associated with risk of chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes.

We employed a cross-sectional design to compare 31 cocaine-na\u00efve participants, 35 occasional cocaine users and 20 regular recreational cocaine users. An emotional facial expression (EFE) task which comprised a male and a female face expressing six basic emotions morphed to differing degrees of emotional intensity was administered together with questionnaires to assess: CD, ASPD and impulsiveness. ASPD was not a significant covariate for EFE performance but impulsiveness and CD were significant covariates. After treating impulsiveness and CD as covariates we again observed a group difference in fear recognition ability attributable to the particularly impaired performance of regular cocaine users. This suggests that, although elevated impulsiveness and CD before the age of 15 years, may predispose a relative inability to recognize facial expressions of fear in adulthood, subsequent regular recreational use of cocaine represents an additional factor that is specifically associated with a selective deficit in fear recognition.", "anno": [[196, 197, true], [365, 366, true], [515, 516, true], [765, 766, true], [876, 877, true], [1071, 1072, true], [1405, 1406, true]]}, {"id": 23501114, "text": "A new compound library that contained 20 hinged benzimidazole-coumarin hybrids and their \u03b2-d-ribofuranosides was established.
