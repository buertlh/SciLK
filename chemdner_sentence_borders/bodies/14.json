PAR4-activating peptide (AP)-stimulated platelets promoted thrombin generation in plasma up to 5 minutes earlier than PAR1-AP-stimulated platelets. PAR4-AP-mediated factor V (FV) association with the platelet surface was 1.6-fold greater than for PAR1-AP. Moreover, PAR4 stimulation resulted in a 3-fold greater release of microparticles, compared with PAR1 stimulation. More robust FV secretion and microparticle generation with PAR4-AP was attributable to stronger and more sustained phosphorylation of myosin light chain at serine 19 and threonine 18. Inhibition of Rho-kinase reduced PAR4-AP-mediated FV secretion and microparticle generation to PAR1-AP-mediated levels. Thrombin generation assays measuring prothrombinase complex activity demonstrated 1.5-fold higher peak thrombin levels on PAR4-AP-stimulated platelets, compared with PAR1-AP-stimulated platelets. Rho-kinase inhibition reduced PAR4-AP-mediated peak thrombin generation by 25% but had no significant effect on PAR1-AP-mediated thrombin generation. In conclusion, stimulation of PAR4 on platelets leads to faster and more robust thrombin generation, compared with PAR1 stimulation. The greater procoagulant potential is related to more efficient FV release from intracellular stores and microparticle production driven by stronger and more sustained myosin light chain phosphorylation.

We show that diet-induced weight loss with CR increases total plasma ghrelin, restores ghrelin sensitivity, and increases hypothalamic NPY and AgRP mRNA expression. We propose that long-term DIO creates a higher body weight set-point and that weight loss induced by CR, as seen in the high-fat CR group, provokes the brain to protect the new higher set-point. This adaptation to weight loss likely contributes to rebound weight gain by increasing peripheral ghrelin concentrations and restoring the function of ghrelin-responsive neuronal populations in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus.

Here, we present facile methods to adjust the structural parameters of microemulsions using different ionic liquids (ILs) as additives (polar phase). We have characterized ILs/[C(4)mim][AOT]/benzene ternary system by performing a phase behavior study, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, and (1)H NMR measurements. The IL loading capacity of microemulsions (area of single phase region) (i) increases with increase in alkyl chain length of cation of ILs and follows the trend [C(6)mim][TF(2)N] > [C(4)mim][TF(2)N] > [C(2)mim][TF(2)N], (ii) increases with decrease in cation anion interaction strength of added ILs and follows the trend [C(4)mim][TF(2)N] > [C(4)mim][PF(6)] > [C(4)mim][BF(4)]. So depending on the IL used, the amount of IL within the core of microemulsions can be easily manipulated to directly affect the size of aggregates in microemulsions. The size increase with increasing R value (R value is defined as the molar ratio of RTILs to [C(4)mim][AOT]) was found to be maximum in the case of [C(2)mim][TF(2)N]/[C(4)mim][AOT]/benzene microemulsions and follows the trend [C(2)mim][TF(2)N] > [C(4)mim][TF(2)N] > [C(6)mim][TF(2)N]. However, the size increase was almost the same with increase in R value in the case of ILs with different anions. The most promising fact about IL-in-oil microemulsions is their high thermal stability compared to that of aqueous microemulsions, so we investigated the effect of temperature on size of aggregates in microemulsions at R = 1.0. It is evident from dynamic light scattering measurements that the aggregates in microemulsions remain monodisperse in nature with increasing temperature, and in all the cases, the size of aggregates in microemulsions decreases with increasing temperature.

In addition, the immunorecognition of the components of these venoms was assessed by immunoaffinity antivenomics. The antivenom proved effective in neutralizing the lethal, hemorrhagic, myotoxic, phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and proteinase activities of the three venoms, albeit exhibiting quantitative differences in the values of the Median Effective Doses (ED(50)). Excepting for certain low molecular mass bands corresponding to disintegrins, and some PLA(2)s and PI-metalloproteinases, Western blotting and immunoaffinity chromatography revealed immunorecognition of most Porthidium and Cerrophidion venom proteins. In agreement with in\u00a0vivo neutralization assays, immobilized antivenom IgGs showed higher immunocapturing activity of toxins from both Porthidium taxa than from C. sasai.

We measured the resulting pharmacokinetic profile of the liposomal carrier and the incorporated temoporfin in a rat model employing a radioactive lipid label and (14)C-temoporfin. The data for the removal of liposomes and temoporfin were analyzed in terms of classical pharmacokinetic theory assuming a two-compartment model.

We therefore additionally analyzed the data based on two separate one-compartment models for the liposomes and temoporfin. The model yields the ratio of the rate constant of temoporfin elimination together with the liposomal carrier and the rate constant of temoporfin elimination following the transfer to e. g. plasma proteins. Our analysis using this model demonstrates that a fraction of temoporfin is released from the liposomes prior to being eliminated from the blood.

Methods: A rat prolactinoma cell line, MMQ, was used in this study. A dose escalation of SZ-685C was performed on this cell line, and cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay. Hoechst 33342, Annexin V-FITC/PI, TUNEL staining and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the extent of apoptosis at each concentration of SZ-685C.

Results: SZ-685C inhibited MMQ cell growth in a dose-dependent manner but showed little toxicity toward rat pituitary cells (RPCs). The IC50s of SZ-685C in MMQ cells and RPCs were 13.2 \u00b1 1.3 mM and 49.1 \u00b1 11.5 mM, respectively, which was statistically significant. Increasing numbers of apoptotic cells were observed in response to escalating concentrations of SZ-685C, and the expression level of prolactin (PRL) was inhibited.

ATM's main function is to orchestrate DNA repair, thereby maintaining genomic stability. ATM activity is increased in response to several stimuli, including ionising radiation (IR) and hypotonic stress. DNMT1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1) is a member of the TIP60-p400 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complex, which acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16) to affect chromatin relaxation and modulate ATM activation. Here we demonstrate that DMAP1 is required for both modes of ATM activation. Knockdown of DMAP1 impaired IR-induced ATM activation and consequently resulted in radiosensitivity and impaired the G2/M checkpoint. Moreover, DMAP1 was also required for efficient ATM signalling in response to hypotonic stress. Overexpression of DMAP1 increased IR-induced ATM substrate phosphorylation, suggesting that DMAP1 function is rate limiting for ATM signalling. DMAP1 associated with TIP60-dependent HAT activity, and depletion of DMAP1 reduced H4K16 acetylation in response to DNA damage. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors rescued IR-induced ATM signalling in Dmap1-depleted cells. These results suggest that DMAP1 is a critical regulator of ATM activity and function.Oncogene advance online publication, 14 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.597.", "anno": [[121, 122, true], [210, 211, true], [324, 325, true], [540, 541, true], [617, 618, true], [751, 752, true], [847, 848, true], [991, 992, true], [1119, 1120, true], [1224, 1225, true], [1311, 1312, true], [1390, 1391, true]]}, {"id": 23318445, "text": "Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder associated with a bone-marrow failure, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Majority of the 15 FA genes and encoded proteins characterized so far are integrated into DNA repair pathways, however, other important functions cannot be excluded. FA cells are sensitive to oxidants, and accumulation of oxidized proteins has been characterized for several FA subgroups. Clinical phenotypes of both FA and other closely related diseases suggest altered functions of mitochondria, organelles responsible for cellular energetic metabolism, and also serving as an important producer and the most susceptible target from reactive oxidative species (ROS). In this study, we have shown that elevated level of mitochondrial ROS in FA cells is in parallel with the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, the decrease of ATP production, impaired oxygen uptake and pathological changes in the morphology of mitochondria. This is accompanied by inactivation of enzymes that are essential for the energy production (F1F0ATPase and cytochrome C oxidase) and detoxification of ROS (superoxide dismutase, SOD1). In turn, overexpression of SOD1 could rescue oxygen consumption rate in FA-deficient cells. Importantly, the depletion of mitochondria improved survival rate of mitomycin C treated FA cells suggesting that hypersensitivity of FA cells to chemotherapeutic drugs could be in part due to the mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress. On the basis of our results, we propose that deficiency in FA genes lead to disabling mitochondrial ROS-scavenging machinery further affecting mitochondrial functions and suppressing cell respiration.Oncogene advance online publication, 14 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.583.", "anno": [[155, 156, true], [321, 322, true], [444, 445, true], [724, 725, true], [991, 992, true], [1177, 1178, true], [1269, 1270, true], [1506, 1507, true], [1707, 1708, true], [1786, 1787, true]]}, {"id": 23318455, "text": "TAM family receptor tyrosine kinases comprising Tyro3 (Sky), Axl, and Mer are overexpressed in some cancers, correlate with multidrug resistance and contribute to tumourigenesis by regulating invasion, angiogenesis, cell survival and tumour growth. Mutations in the gene coding for a tumour suppressor merlin cause development of multiple tumours of the nervous system such as schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as part of a hereditary disease neurofibromatosis type 2. The benign character of merlin-deficient tumours makes them less responsive to chemotherapy. We previously showed that, amongst other growth factor receptors, TAM family receptors (Tyro3, Axl and Mer) are significantly overexpressed in schwannoma tissues. As Axl is negatively regulated by merlin and positively regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1, previously shown to be a key regulator in schwannoma growth we hypothesized that Axl is a good target to study in merlin-deficient tumours. Moreover, Axl positively regulates the oncogene Yes-associated protein, which is known to be under merlin regulation in schwannoma and is involved in increased proliferation of merlin-deficient meningioma and mesothelioma. Here, we demonstrated strong overexpression and activation of Axl receptor as well as its ligand Gas6 in human schwannoma primary cells compared to normal Schwann cells. We show that Gas6 is mitogenic and increases schwannoma cell-matrix adhesion and survival acting via Axl in schwannoma cells. Stimulation of the Gas6/Axl signalling pathway recruits Src, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and NF\u03baB. We showed that NF\u03baB mediates Gas6/Axl-mediated overexpression of survivin, cyclin D1 and FAK, leading to enhanced survival, cell-matrix adhesion and proliferation of schwannoma.

B7-H4 protein was detected on the membrane, in the cytosol and/or in the nucleus in tumor tissues. The membrane and nuclear expression of B7-H4 was significantly correlated with the tumor stages of RCC. Moreover, the membrane localization of B7-H4 was inversely correlated with the intensity of tumor infiltrates lymphocyte (TILs), whereas no association was observed between nuclear expression of B7-H4 and the density of TILs status. We further identified that B7-H4 is a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling protein containing a functional nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif. A point mutation of B7-H4 NLS motif blocked the leptomycin B -induced nuclear accumulation of B7-H4. HEK293 cells stably expressing B7-H4 NLS mutant exhibited more potent inhibition in T-cell proliferation and cytokine production through increasing its surface expression compared with wild-type B7-H4 transfected cells owing to their increased surface expression. Most importantly, overexpression of wild-type B7-H4 in HEK293 cells enhanced tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, promoted G1/S phase transition. The regulation of cell cycle by wild-type B7-H4 was partialy due to upregulation of Cyclin D 1 and Cyclin E.

Furthermore, B7-H4 wild-type confers chemoresistance activity to RCC cell lines including Caki-1 and ACHN.

These findings confirm further that 5-HT2A antagonists promote the maintenance of sleep, and suggest that combining a 5-HT2A antagonist with a short-acting hypnotic may be a useful strategy for the treatment of insomnia.", "anno": [[191, 192, true], [391, 392, true], [603, 604, true], [709, 710, true], [773, 774, true], [929, 930, true], [1037, 1038, true], [1177, 1178, true], [1338, 1339, true], [1559, 1560, true]]}, {"id": 23321916, "text": "This work reports the voltammetric behaviour of decamethylcobaltocenium, DmCc(+), in different ionic liquids for the first time. Its redox potential was studied relative to that of decamethylferrocene, DmFc, and it is shown that the difference in the mid-point potential between these two permethylated transition-metal sandwich complexes is independent of the ionic liquid composition. A variable difference in mid-point potential, in contrast, was observed for ferrocene and cobaltocenium relative to that of DmFc in similar ionic liquids. In addition, different limitations in the application of DmFc(0/+) and DmCc(+/0) couples as internal reference redox systems in ILs are discussed. From these, the observed spontaneous reaction between DmFc and oxygen leads to important implications toward the establishment of particular conditions for DmFc applications.", "anno": [[127, 128, true], [385, 386, true], [540, 541, true], [687, 688, true], [862, 863, true]]}, {"id": 23322164, "text": "Acylcarnitines are commonly used in the diagnosis of mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation disorders (mFAODs). It is generally assumed that this plasma acylcarnitine profile reflects the mitochondrial accumulation of acyl-CoAs. The identity of the enzymes and the mitochondrial and plasmalemmal transporters involved in the synthesis and export of these metabolites have remained undefined. We used lentiviral shRNA to knock down the expression of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) in control and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2)-, carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT)-, and plasmalemmal carnitine transporter (OCTN2)-deficient human fibroblasts. These cell lines, including mock-transduced controls, were loaded with decanoic acid and carnitine, followed by the measurement of the acylcarnitine profile in the extracellular medium. In control fibroblasts, MCAD knockdown markedly increased the production of octanoylcarnitine (3-fold, P<0.01). OCTN2-deficient cell lines also showed extracellular accumulation of octanoylcarnitine (2.8-fold, P<0.01), suggesting that the cellular export of acylcarnitines does not depend on OCTN2. In contrast, in CPT2- and CACT-deficient cells, the accumulation of octanoylcarnitine in the medium did not significantly increase in the MCAD knockdown. Similar results were obtained using pharmacological inhibition of CPT2 in fibroblasts from MCAD-deficient individuals. This shows that CPT2 and CACT are crucial for mitochondrial acylcarnitine formation and export to the extracellular fluids in mFAOD.-Violante, S., IJlst, L., te Brinke, H., Tavares de Almeida, I., Wanders, R.

The identification of pathways regulating the acute toxicological effects of these particles provides specific targets for therapeutic manipulation in an attempt to impact disease following exposures. Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels were identified as \"particle sensors\" in that their activation was coupled with the initiation of protective responses limiting airway deposition and inflammatory responses, which promote degradation and clearance of the particles. TRPA1, V1, V4, and M8 have a capacity to mediate adverse effects after exposure to combustion-generated particulate matter (PM); relative contributions of each depend upon particle composition, dose, and deposition. Exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to an organic extract of diesel exhaust particle was followed by TRPV4 mediating Ca(++) influx, increased RAS expression, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 activation. These novel pathways of biological effect can be targeted by compounds that specifically inhibit critical signaling reactions. In addition to TRPs and calcium biochemistry, humic-like substances (HLS) and cell/tissue iron equilibrium were identified as potential mechanistic targets in lung injury after particle exposure. In respiratory epithelial cells, iron sequestration by HLS in wood smoke particle (WSP) was associated with oxidant generation, cell signaling, transcription factor activation, and release of inflammatory mediators. Similar to WSP, cytotoxic insoluble nanosized spherical particles composed of HLS were isolated from cigarette smoke condensate. Therapies that promote bioelimination of HLS and prevent the disruption of iron homeostasis could function to reduce the harmful effects of combustion-generated PM exposure.", "anno": [[112, 113, true], [313, 314, true], [596, 597, true], [812, 813, true], [1066, 1067, true], [1193, 1194, true], [1389, 1390, true], [1605, 1606, true], [1734, 1735, true], [1908, 1909, true]]}]}
