The control of ribosome biogenesis by c-Myc through the regulation of transcription mediated by all three RNA polymerases is essential for c-Myc-driven proliferation. Specifically, in the nucleolus, c-Myc has been shown to be recruited to ribosomal DNA and activate RNA polymerase (pol) I-mediated transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. In addition, c-Myc accumulates in nucleoli upon inhibition of the proteasome, suggesting nucleolar localization also has a role in c-Myc proteolysis. Nucleophosmin (NPM), a predominantly nucleolar protein, is also critical in ribosome biogenesis and, like c-Myc, is found overexpressed in many types of tumors. Previously, we demonstrated that NPM directly interacts with c-Myc and controls c-Myc-induced hyperproliferation and transformation. Here, we show that NPM is necessary for the localization of c-Myc protein to nucleoli, whereas c-Myc nucleolar localization is independent of p53, Mdm2 and ARF. Conversely, high transient NPM expression enhances c-Myc nucleolar localization, leading to increased c-Myc proteolysis. In addition, NPM is necessary for the ability of c-Myc to induce rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus, and constitutive NPM overexpression stimulates c-Myc-mediated rRNA synthesis.

The underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, but they are distinct from those related to gastric injury. Based on recent insights from experimental models, including genetics and pharmacology in rodents typically exposed to diclofenac, indomethacin, or naproxen, we propose a multiple-hit pathogenesis of NSAID enteropathy. The multiple hits start with an initial pharmacokinetic determinant caused by vectorial hepatobiliary excretion and delivery of glucuronidated NSAID or oxidative metabolite conjugates to the distal small intestinal lumen, where bacterial \u03b2-glucuronidase produces critical aglycones. The released aglycones are then taken up by enterocytes and further metabolized by intestinal cytochrome P450s to potentially reactive intermediates. The \"first hit\" is caused by the NSAID and/or oxidative metabolites that induce severe endoplasmic reticulum stress or mitochondrial stress and lead to cell death. The \"second hit\" is created by the significant subsequent inflammatory response that would follow such a first-hit injury. Based on these putative mechanisms, strategies have been developed to protect the enterocytes from being exposed to the parent NSAID and/or oxidative metabolites. Among these, a novel strategy already demonstrated in a murine model is the selective disruption of bacteria-specific \u03b2-glucuronidases with a novel small molecule inhibitor that does not harm the bacteria and that alleviates NSAID-induced enteropathy.

A face-to-face interview was conducted with physicians to assess their knowledge and attitude regarding RUD. RESULTS: A large majority of the physicians declared that consultation time was insufficient (84\u00a0%). The data obtained from the survey indicate that 54\u00a0% of the enrolled physicians monitored the therapeutic outcome and that 27\u00a0% found the information given to the patient to be sufficient. Participating physicians stated that the less known characteristics of the drugs they prescribed were drug interactions, traceability in market, and price. The most preferred reference source was Vademecum (a drug guideline prepared by the private sector). Two major factors contributing to prescribing patterns were \"self study\" and \"observation of teachers\" at clinical training.

To model these components in rats, we administered high corticosterone (CORT) postpartum, which increases immobility in the forced swim test (FST), and reduces maternal care, body weight and hippocampal cell proliferation in dams. The hippocampus is altered in response to chronic stress, exposure to high glucocorticoids and in major depression in humans. In the present study, we examined whether high CORT reduced dendritic complexity and spines in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Additionally, housing complexity was manipulated so that dams and litters were housed either with tubes (complex) or without tubes (impoverished) to investigate the consequences of new animal care regulations. Dams received 40 mg/kg/day of CORT or oil starting on day 2 postpartum for 23 days. Maternal behaviours were assessed on postpartum days 2-8 and dams were tested using the FST on days 21 and 22. Dams were killed on day 24 and brains were processed for Golgi impregnation. Pyramidal cells in the CA3 subfield were traced using a camera lucida and analysed for branch points and dendritic complexity, as well as spine density and type on both basal and apical arbours. As previously established, high CORT postpartum reduced maternal care and increased immobility in the FST, which is a measure of depressive-like behaviour. High CORT postpartum reduced the complexity of basal arbours and increased mushroom spines on both apical and basal dendrites. Housing complexity had no effect on spines of CA3 pyramidal cells but modest effects on cell morphology. These data show that chronic high CORT in postpartum females alters hippocampal morphology and may provide insight regarding the neurobiological consequences of high stress or CORT during the postpartum period, as well as be relevant for postpartum stress or depression.", "anno": [[83, 84, true], [292, 293, true], [523, 524, true], [649, 650, true], [779, 780, true], [989, 990, true], [1073, 1074, true], [1184, 1185, true], [1261, 1262, true], [1456, 1457, true], [1612, 1613, true], [1739, 1740, true], [1844, 1845, true], [2115, 2116, true]]}, {"id": 23197773, "text": "Behavioral studies of chronic CB(1) receptor activation may provide a pharmacological approach to understanding efficacy-related differences among CB(1) ligands as well as mechanistic commonalities between cannabinoid and noncannabinoid drugs.

The multiple cortical glutamatergic and mesolimbic dopaminergic (DAergic) afferences on the same neurons in the ventral striatum provide the neuroanatomical substrate for glutamate and dopamine functional interaction. However, there is little evidence in the literature on how this interaction affects the ability to encode spatial information. OBJECTIVE: First, we evaluated the effect of intra-VS bilateral infusion of different doses of amphetamine (0.3, 0.75, and 1.5\u00a0\u03bcg/side) on the ability to detect spatial novelty in mice. Next, we examined the impact produced on the same abilities by intra-VS infusion of ineffective doses of amphetamine (0.3\u00a0\u03bcg/side) in association with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (3.125\u00a0ng/side) or \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) (0.25\u00a0ng/side) receptor antagonist. RESULTS: The results show that infusion of amphetamine impairs detection of spatial novelty, affecting also exploratory activity and marginally the detection of nonspatial novelty. In contrast, an association of subthreshold doses of amphetamine with NMDA or AMPA receptor antagonists exerted a selective effect on reactivity to a spatial change.

The fiber organization was varied by fine-tuning the microtopography of the electrospinning collector. Fiber conformity and alignment were influenced by the depth and the slope of microtopography features, resulting in scaffolds comprising either an array of microdomains with different porosity and fiber alignment or an array of microwells.

Emerging data implicate environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals as contributors to the obesity and diabetes epidemics. Previous studies have shown that the phenylsulfamide fungicide tolylfluanid (TF) augments glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent luciferase expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes while modulating insulin action in primary murine and human adipocytes. Studies were performed to interrogate glucocorticoid signaling in primary adipocytes exposed to TF. TF mimicked the gene transcription profile of the murine glucocorticoid corticosterone (Cort). Cellular fractionation assays demonstrated that TF treatment promoted the activating serine phosphorylation of GR, augmenting its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation as well as its enrichment at glucocorticoid response elements on the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper gene promoter. After acute treatment, Cort or TF promoted insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene and protein expression. Either treatment also enriched GR binding at an identified glucocorticoid response element in the IRS-1 gene. TF or Cort each increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis, an effect resulting from increased lipogenic gene expression and enhanced insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. The augmentation of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis was mediated through a specific enhancement of Akt phosphorylation at T308. These findings support modulation of IRS-1 levels as a mechanism for glucocorticoid-mediated changes in insulin action in primary adipocytes.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the autoinduction of amphiregulin (AREG), a member of the EGF family. We found that ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure increased the AREG mRNA level by stabilization of its mRNA in a human immortalized keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. The 3' UTR of AREG mRNA was responsible for binding to an mRNA-binding protein, human antigen R (HuR), and the interaction between AREG mRNA and HuR was enhanced by UVB. Inducible knockdown of HuR expression significantly decreased AREG mRNA stability. Interestingly, treatment of HaCaT cells with an EGFR inhibitor, an EGFR neutralizing antibody, or an ADAM inhibitor destabilized AREG mRNA. In the case of ADAM inhibition, administration of soluble AREG restored the mRNA level, indicating that the stabilization occurs in a shedding-dependent manner of EGFR ligands. The HuR dependence of AREG mRNA and protein expression was also confirmed in human primary keratinocytes. Taken together, we propose a novel mechanism by which HuR regulates the stability of AREG mRNA in keratinocytes after UVB exposure and suggest that targeting of HuR functions might be crucial for understanding skin cancers caused by aberrant EGF family member-EGFR signaling.", "anno": [[203, 204, true], [326, 327, true], [392, 393, true], [520, 521, true], [677, 678, true], [847, 848, true], [930, 931, true], [1070, 1071, true], [1247, 1248, true], [1353, 1354, true], [1629, 1630, true]]}, {"id": 23303207, "text": "In our previous work, we found that feeding Lactobacillus johnsonii to BioBreeding diabetes-prone (BBDP) rats decreased the incidence of diabetes development.

If the collagen sandwich cultures of hepatocytes really produce false-positive data, this would compromise its application in toxicogenomics. To revisit the putative in vivo/in vitro discrepancy, we first analyzed and modeled methapyrilene concentrations in the portal vein of rats. The relatively short half-life of 2.8 h implies a rapid decrease in orally administered methapyrilene in vivo below concentrations that can cause gene expression alterations. This corresponded to the time-dependent alteration levels of GADD34, ABAT and SULT1A1 RNA in the liver: RNA levels are altered 1, 6 and 12 h after methapyrilene administration, but return to control levels after 24 and 72 h. In contrast, methapyrilene concentrations in the culture medium supernatant of primary rat hepatocyte cultures decreased slowly. This explains why GADD34, ABAT and SULT1A1 were still deregulated after 24 h exposure in vitro, but not in vivo. It should also be considered that the earliest analyzed time point in the previous in vivo studies was 24 h after methapyrilene administration.

End points were coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, noncardiovascular mortality, overt nephropathy defined by persistent proteinuria, and progression of retinopathy. We fit a multistate Cox regression model to derive an algorithm for prediction. The predictive accuracy of the calculated 5-year risks was cross-validated. RESULTS Sex, age, HbA1c, years after diagnosis, BMI, systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, atrial fibrillation, current smoker, and leisure-time physical activity were risk factors for macro- and microvascular complications and were incorporated into the risk engine. The observed-to-predicted (O/P) ratios for each event were between 0.93 and 1.08, and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests showed no significant deviations between observed and predicted events.

We also found that Rab12 promotes constitutive degradation of PAT4 (proton-coupled amino-acid transporter 4), whose accumulation in Rab12-knockdown cells modulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of regulation of mTORC1 signalling and autophagy, that is, quality control of PAT4 by Rab12.", "anno": [[133, 134, true], [254, 255, true], [387, 388, true], [568, 569, true], [763, 764, true], [892, 893, true]]}, {"id": 23596058, "text": "Liver first-pass metabolism differs considerably among organic nitrates but little information exists on the mechanism of denitration of these compounds in hepatic tissue. The metabolism of nitrooxybutyl-esters of flurbiprofen and ferulic-acid, a class of organic nitrates with potential therapeutic implication in variety of different conditions, was investigated in comparison with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in human liver by a multiple approach, using a spontaneous metabolism-independent NO donor (NOC-5) as a reference tool. Nitrooxybutyl-esters were rapidly and quantitatively metabolized to their respective parent compounds and the organic nitrate moiety nitrooxybutyl-alcohol (NOBA). Differently from GTN which was rapidly and completely metabolized to nitrite, NOBA was slowly metabolized to nitrate. In contrast to the spontaneous NO donor NOC-5, NOBA and GTN did not generate detectable NO and failed to suppress the activity of cytochromeP450; an enzyme known to be inhibited by NO. The direct identification of NOBA following liver metabolism targets this compound as the functional organic nitrate metabolite of nitrooxybutyl-esters. Moreover the investigation of the pathways for denitration of NOBA and GTN suggests that organic nitrates are not primarily metabolized to NO in the liver but to different extents of nitrite or nitrate depending from their different chemical structure. It follows that cytochromeP450-dependent metabolism of concomitant drugs is not likely to be affected by oral co-administration of organic nitrates. However the first-pass may differently affect the pharmacological profile of organic nitrates in connection with the different extent of denitration and the distinct bioactive species generated and exported from the liver (nitrate or nitrite).", "anno": [[170, 171, true], [528, 529, true], [691, 692, true], [809, 810, true], [994, 995, true], [1147, 1148, true], [1400, 1401, true], [1549, 1550, true], [1793, 1794, true]]}]}
