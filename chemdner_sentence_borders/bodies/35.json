The dataset for analysis comprised 7,597 cases. Proportions meeting process and outcome criteria were determined, including between-country variations. Logistic regression was used to investigate potential predictors of meeting targets for HbA1c, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol.RESULTSIn the total sample, adherence to process recommendations was high for some measures, for example, HbA1c recorded in past 12 months in 97.6% of cases. Target achievement for intermediate outcome measures was lower, with only 53.6% having HbA1c <7%. Considerable between-country variation was identified for both processes and outcomes. The following characteristics were associated with an increased likelihood of meeting targets for all three measures considered (HbA1c, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol): shorter diagnosis of diabetes; having one or more macrovascular complications; lower BMI; being prescribed lipid-lowering medication; and no current antihypertensive prescribing.CONCLUSIONSCompared with earlier reports, we have suggested some encouraging positive trends in Europe in relation to meeting targets for the management of people with type 2 diabetes, but there is still scope for further improvement and greater between-country consistency.", "anno": [[9, 10, true], [206, 207, true], [233, 234, true], [574, 575, true], [622, 623, true], [726, 727, true], [858, 859, true], [865, 866, true], [1015, 1016, true], [1113, 1114, true], [1200, 1201, true], [1549, 1550, true], [1560, 1561, true], [1823, 1824, true]]}, {"id": 23628674, "text": "Wuzhi capsule (WZC) is a preparation of an ethanol herbal extract of Schisandra sphenanthera(Nan-Wuweizi), with its main active ingredients including schisandrin, schisandrol B, schisantherin A, schisanhenol and deoxyshisandrin.

We repeated these analyses with the removal of individual loci to determine if any a locus has a disproportionate effect on our phylogenetic results. Collectively, these results robustly resolved many deep and relatively shallow clades within Ambystoma, including the placement of A. gracile and A. talpoideum as the sister clade to a clade containing all remaining ambystomatids, and the placement of A. maculatum as the sister lineage to all remaining ambystomatids excluding A. gracile and A. talpoideum. Both Bayesian coalescent and concordance methods produced similar results, highlighting strongly supported branches in the species tree. Furthermore, coalescent-based analyses that excluded loci produced overlapping species-tree posterior distributions, suggesting that no particular locus - including mtDNA - disproportionately contributed to our species-tree estimates. Overall, our phylogenetic estimates have greater similarity with previous allozyme and mitochondrial sequence-based phylogenetic estimates. However, intermediate depths of divergence in the ambystomatid species tree remain unresolved, potentially highlighting a region of rapid species radiation or a hard polytomy, and which limits our ability to comment on previous morphologically-based taxonomic groups.", "anno": [[141, 142, true], [239, 240, true], [539, 540, true], [665, 666, true], [923, 924, true], [1073, 1074, true], [1431, 1432, true], [1568, 1569, true], [1803, 1804, true], [1943, 1944, true], [2211, 2212, true]]}, {"id": 23632081, "text": "Serotonin transporters (SERT) play an essential role in the termination and regulation of serotonin signaling in the brain. SERT is also the target of antidepressants and psychostimulants. Molecules with novel activities and modes of interaction with regard to SERT function are of great scientific and clinical interest. We explored structural regions outside the putative serotonin translocation pathway to identify potential binding sites for allosteric transporter modulators (ATMs). Mutational studies revealed a pocket of amino acids outside the orthosteric substrate binding sites located in the interface between extracellular loops 1 and 3 that when mutated affect transporter function. Using the structure of the bacterial transporter homologue leucine transporter as a template, we developed a structural model of SERT. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the allosteric pocket that was identified by site-directed mutagenesis studies and employed this pocket in a virtual screen for small-molecule modulators of SERT function. In functional transport assays, we found that one of the identified molecules, ATM7, increased the reuptake of serotonin, possibly by facilitating the interaction of serotonin with transport-ready conformations of SERT when concentrations of serotonin were low and rate limiting. In addition, ATM7 potentiates 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA, \"Ecstasy\")-induced reversed transport by SERT. Taking advantage of a conformationally sensitive residue in transmembrane domain 6, we demonstrate that ATM7 mechanistically stabilizes an outward-facing conformation of SERT.

In the majority of neurons tested, TRH induced reversible TTX-resistant membrane depolarization. Under voltage-clamp, TRH induced a concentration-dependent G protein- mediated inward current. The mean net TRH-induced current exhibited a decrease in membrane conductance. Further analyses identified two concurrent conductances contributing to the TRH-induced response. One conductance featured a Na(+)-independent and K(+)-dependent net current that displayed rectification and was suppressed by micromolar concentrations of Ba(2+) and two GIRK antagonists, tertiapin Q and SCH 23390. The second conductance featured a Na(+)-dependent net inward current with an I-V relationship that exhibited double rectification with a negative slope conductance below -40 mV.

RESULTS:: LC-MS based metabolomics could be an advanced tool to help us find metabolites with regards to its capacity of processing large datasets, differentiating and classifying of sample groups, as well as its indiscriminative nature of biomarker and metabolite identification. Using this method, seven metabolites were identified, which are flavonoid aglycone glucuronidation, sulfatation, and methylation metabolites.

METHODS: Dual-probe microdialysis in the locus coeruleus (LC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was performed in freely awake rats. RESULTS: Systemic citalopram (10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) increased noradrenaline (NA) in the LC (E max\u2009=\u2009141\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u00a0%) and simultaneously decreased NA in the PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009-46\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u00a0%). In the local presence into the LC of the \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist RS79948 (1\u00a0\u03bcM), systemic citalopram increased NA in the LC (Emax\u2009=\u2009157\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0%) and PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009175\u2009\u00b1\u200924\u00a0%). Local citalopram (0.1-100\u00a0\u03bcM) into the LC induced NA increase in the LC (Emax\u2009=\u2009210\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u00a0%) and decrease in the PFC (Emax\u2009=\u2009-38\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u00a0%). Local LC citalopram effect was abolished by LC presence of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist MDL72222 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) but not the 5-HT1/2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (1\u00a0\u03bcM).

We utilized a series of chemical stability tests in conjunction with bioassays to show that thiol-conjugates display chemopreventative potency by acting as carriers of active ginger component 6S. M2 chemical degradation to 6S was observed in an environment most resembling physiological conditions, with a pH of 7.4 at 37\u00b0C. The metabolic profiles of M2 in cancer cells HCT-116 and H-1299 resembled those of 6S, indicating that its biotransformation route was initiated by deconjugation. Further, the presence of excess glutathione significantly delayed 6S and M2 metabolism and counteracted cell death induced by 6S and M2, suggesting that increasing available free thiols exogenously both promoted formation of 5-glutathionyl-[6]-shogaol (M13) and inhibited the production of free 6S from M2 deconjugation, resulting in delayed 6S cell entry and bioactivity. Given the chemopreventative properties of M2 and our observations in vitro, we investigated its metabolism in mice. M2 and 6S showed similar metabolic profiles in mouse urine and fecal samples. Six new thiol-conjugated metabolites (M16-M21), together with previously reported ones, were identified by LC/MS. In particular, the increase of 5-N-acetylcystenyl-[6]-shogaol (M5) and its 3-demethylated product (M16) abundance in mouse feces after treatment with M2 indicate that in addition to acting as a carrier of 6S, M2 is also directly acetylated to M5, which is further demethylated to M16 in vivo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of PF-W and its components on motilin or ghrelin receptor was determined by calcium imaging and whole-cell patch clamp methods.

Indeed, the DSM-IV recognizes that social, occupational and/or recreational activities become reduced as a consequence of repeated drug use where previously rewarding experiences (e.g., food, job, family) become devalued as the addict continues to seek and use drug despite serious negative consequences. Here, research in the Carelli laboratory is reviewed that examined neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie these processes using a novel animal model. Oromotor responses (taste reactivity) were examined as rats learned that intraoral infusion of a sweet (e.g., saccharin) predicts impending but delayed access to cocaine self-administration. We showed that rats exhibit aversive taste reactivity (i.e., gapes/rejection responses) during infusion of the sweet paired with impending cocaine, similar to aversive responses observed during infusion of quinine, a bitter tastant. Critically, the expression of this pronounced aversion to the sweet predicted the subsequent motivation to self-administer cocaine. Electrophysiology studies show that this shift in palatability corresponds to an alteration in nucleus accumbens (NAc) cell firing; neurons that previously responded with inhibition during infusion of the palatable sweet shifted to excitatory activity during infusion of the cocaine-devalued tastant. This excitatory response profile is typically observed during infusion of quinine, indicating that the once palatable sweet becomes aversive following its association with impending but delayed cocaine, and NAc neurons encode this aversive state. We also review electrochemical studies showing a shift (from increase to decrease) in rapid NAc dopamine release during infusion of the cocaine-paired tastant as the aversive state developed, again, resulting in responses similar to quinine infusion. Collectively, our findings suggest that cocaine-conditioned cues elicit a cocaine-need state that is aversive, is encoded by a distinct subset of NAc neurons and rapid dopamine signaling, and promotes cocaine-seeking behavior. Finally, we present data showing that experimentally induced abstinence (30 days) exacerbates this natural reward devaluation by cocaine, and this effect is correlated with a greater motivation to lever press during extinction. Dissecting the neural mechanisms underlying these detrimental consequences of addiction is critical since it may lead to novel treatments that ameliorate negative affective states associated with drug use and decrease the drive (craving) for the drug.

Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata. However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent. AIM OF THE STUDY: We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines. We also tried to find out the active constituent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations of licorice, glycyrrhizin and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (18\u03b2-GA), the active constituents of licorice, were examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Abilities of crude licorice to inhibit viral replication and to stimulate IFN-\u03b2 were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. RESULTS: Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (p<0.0001). The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells. However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells. Besides, glycyrrhizin was ineffective at all. Nevertheless, 18\u03b2-GA showed a potent anti-HRSV activity. Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p<0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (p<0.0001) and penetration (p<0.0001) into the host cells. The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. 300\u03bcg/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension. Radix Glycyrrhizae might further stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN-\u03b2 to counteract viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata are effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelial cells. Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV mainly by preventing viral attachment, internalization, and by stimulating IFN secretion. 18\u03b2-GA may be one of its active constituents.", "anno": [[30, 31, true], [161, 162, true], [339, 340, true], [432, 433, true], [563, 564, true], [581, 582, true], [720, 721, true], [770, 771, true], [793, 794, true], [1066, 1067, true], [1282, 1283, true], [1291, 1292, true], [1446, 1447, true], [1548, 1549, true], [1623, 1624, true], [1669, 1670, true], [1726, 1727, true], [1928, 1929, true], [2018, 2019, true], [2123, 2124, true], [2228, 2229, true], [2241, 2242, true], [2363, 2364, true], [2487, 2488, true], [2533, 2534, true]]}, {"id": 23643664, "text": "Hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons remain unaffected in Parkinson disease (PD) while there is significant degeneration of midbrain nigrostriatal dopamine (NSDA) neurons.

In the present study, the response of TIDA and NSDA neurons to acute MPTP administration following chronic MPTP exposure was examined. Mice were treated with ten injections of either MPTP (20 mg/kg; s.c.; every 3.5 days) or saline vehicle (10 ml/kg; s.c.; every 3.5 days). Following a 21 day recovery period, chronic saline- and MPTP-treated mice received an additional injection of either saline (10 ml/kg; s.c.) or MPTP (20 mg/kg; s.c.) and were sacrificed 24 h later. NSDA neurons displayed significant axon terminal degeneration (as indexed by decreases in DA, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DA transporter concentrations in the striatum) as well as loss of TH-immunoreactive (IR) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) following MPTP, whereas TIDA neurons revealed no overt axon terminal pathology or loss of TH-IR cell bodies. NSDA neuronal pathology was associated with transient decreases in concentrations of parkin and UCHL-1 protein in the SN, which returned to normal levels by 21 days following cessation of chronic neurotoxicant exposure. Resistance of TIDA neurons to MPTP toxicity was correlated with a transient increase in UCHL-1 and a sustained elevation in parkin in the arcuate nucleus. TIDA neurons represent a DA neuron population with a unique and inherent ability to adapt to acute and chronic toxicant administration with a sustained elevation of the neuroprotective protein parkin.

Low doses of N/OFQ and NOP receptor antagonists promoted movement whereas higher doses inhibited it.

Motor facilitation induced by NOP receptor antagonists as well as low dose N/OFQ is mediated through D2L postsynaptic receptors whereas motor inhibition observed with higher doses of N/OFQ occurs by direct inhibition of mesencephalic DA neurons. Motor inhibition seen with high doses of NOP receptor antagonists appears to be mediated through the D2 presynaptic autoreceptors.

The global expression of lncRNAs and coding genes was analyzed with the Human LncRNA Array V2.0 after 24h treatment. Expression was verified in cell lines and tissues by quantitative real-time PCR. The data showed that 4.8% (959) of lncRNA and 6.1% (1849) of protein coding gene were significantly differentially expressed. The differential expressions of lncRNA and protein coding genes had distinguishable hierarchical clustering expression profiling pattern. Among these differentially expressed lncRNAs, the greatest change was noted for uc002mbe.2, which had more than 300 folds induction upon TSA treatment. TSA selectively induced uc002mbe.2 in four studied HCC cell lines. Compared with normal human hepatocytes and adjacent noncancerous tissues, uc002mbe.2 expression level was significantly lower in the HCC cell lines and liver cancer tissues. The TSA-induced uc002mbe.2 expression was positively correlated with the apoptotic effect of TSA in HCC cells. In addition, knockdown the expression of uc002mbe.2 significantly reduced TSA-induced apoptosis of Huh7cells. Therefore, TSA-induced apoptosis of HCC cells is uc002mbe.2 dependent and reduced expression of uc002mbe.2 may be associated with liver carcinogenesis.", "anno": [[102, 103, true], [289, 290, true], [412, 413, true], [529, 530, true], [610, 611, true], [736, 737, true], [874, 875, true], [1026, 1027, true], [1093, 1094, true], [1267, 1268, true], [1378, 1379, true], [1488, 1489, true], [1640, 1641, true]]}, {"id": 23644192, "text": "Four (99m)Tc-labeled dibenzylideneacetone derivatives and corresponding rhenium complexes were successfully synthesized and biologically evaluated as potential imaging probes for A\u03b2 plaques using SPECT.

Aims: to evaluate the effects of co-administration of IBU and ISDN (a) on left ventricular (LV) structure and function, and (b) on cardiac inflammatory response and fibrosis in mdx mice. METHODS: three groups of mice were studied: mdx mice treated with IBU (50mgkg(-1))+ISDN (30mgkg(-1)) administered daily in the diet, mdx mice that received standard diet without drugs and wild type aged-matched mice. Animals were analysed after 10-11 months of treatment. Structural and functional parameters were evaluated by echocardiography while histological analyses were performed to evaluate inflammatory response, collagen deposition, cardiomyocyte number and area. RESULTS: treatment for 10-11 months with IBU+ISDN preserved LV wall thickness and LV mass. Drug treatment also preserved the total number of cardiomyocytes in the LV and attenuated the increase in cardiomyocyte size, when compared to untreated mdx mice. Moreover, a trend towards a decreased number of inflammatory cells, a reduced LV myocardial interstitial fibrosis and an enhanced global LV function response to stress was observed in treated mdx mice.

However, to exploit this potential, a method for direct conversion of spin information into an electric signal is indispensable. Here we show that a pure spin current can be produced in a solution-processed conducting polymer by pumping spins through a ferromagnetic resonance in an adjacent magnetic insulator, and that this generates an electric voltage across the polymer film. We demonstrate that the experimental characteristics of the generated voltage are consistent with it being generated through an inverse spin Hall effect in the conducting polymer.

Unlike conventional associative memories where charge retention is a key function and hence, they require frequent refresh cycles, in ACNs, information is retained in a nonvolatile resistive state and normal tasks are carried out through capacitive coupling between input and output nodes. Each device consists of two CRS cells and no selective element is needed, therefore, CMOS circuitry is only required in the periphery, for addressing and read-out. Highly parallel processing, nonvolatility, wide interconnectivity and low-energy consumption are significant advantages of ACNs over conventional and emerging associative memories.
