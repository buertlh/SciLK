However, increased STAT3 activity in the tumor microenvironment makes DCs tolerogenic and suppresses their antitumor activity.

We found that E7-antigen expressing STAT3(-/-) DC (E7-DC-1STAT3(-/-)) vaccination enhanced generation of E7-specific CD8(+) T cells, but was not enough to control TC-1(P3) cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated whether bortezomib could create a synergistic effect with E7-DC-1STAT3(-/-) vaccination. We found that apoptosis via down-regulation of STAT3 and NF-\u03baB and up-regulation of Fas and death receptor 5 (DR5) expression in TC-1(P3) induced by bortezomib was independent of p53 status. We also observed that TC-1(P3) cells pretreated with bortezomib had markedly enhanced anti-tumor effects on E7-specific CD8(+) T cells through a Fas/DR5-mediated mechanism. In addition, TC-1(P3) tumor-bearing mice treated with bortezomib prior to vaccination with E7-DC-1STAT3(-/-) demonstrated enhanced generation of E7-specific CD8(+) T cells and prolonged survival compared to those treated with monotherapy.

AKR1C3 inhibitors should not inhibit AKR1C1/AKR1C2, which inactivate 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone. Indomethacin, used to inhibit cyclooxygenase, also inhibits AKR1C3 and displays selectivity over AKR1C1/AKR1C2. Parallel synthetic strategies were used to generate libraries of indomethacin analogues, which exhibit reduced cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity but retain AKR1C3 inhibitory potency and selectivity. The lead compounds inhibited AKR1C3 with nanomolar potency, displayed >100-fold selectivity over AKR1C1/AKR1C2, and blocked testosterone formation in LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells.

Deposited particulates adhere to the mucus and are cleared via mucociliary transport and via cough. Mucins are major constituents of mucus, which is important in the clearance of inhaled materials. Normally, secreted mucus is cleared without symptoms or interference with lung function. However, in obstructive airway diseases such as COPD, asthma, and cystic fibrosis, excessive mucus is produced. Because of the prominence of mucous hypersecretion as a cause of cough, this discussion focuses on mechanisms regulating normal production of mucins and the mechanisms underlying exaggerated mucin secretion in chronic obstructive airway diseases. Mucins are produced by airway epithelial cells via a cascade of signals (the Epidermal Growth Factor Cascade) and secreted on the luminal epithelial surface, often in response to the deposition of inhaled irritants. Normally, only minimal amounts of mucins are secreted, which assist in clearance of the inhaled particulates. However, in disease, additional pathways are induced via positive feedback systems, which lead to mucous hypersecretion. In the large conducting airways, where cough receptors are concentrated, mucous hypersecretion causes stimulation of neural receptors that result in cough. However, in small airways (e.g., bronchioles), because of their small diameters, mucous hypersecretion leads to plugging of the airways. Because there are so many small airways, their plugging is difficult to detect early, and this locus is known as a \"silent zone.\" In chronic obstructive airway diseases, plugging of small airways may persist and increase over time, finally resulting in severe airway obstruction.

METHODS: Ninety healthy Japanese individuals were enrolled and classified into the three different CYP2C19 genotype groups: homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs; n\u2009=\u200934), heterozygous EMs (htEMs; n\u2009=\u200944), and poor metabolizers (PMs; n\u2009=\u200912).

RESULTS: Mean plasma concentrations of (R)- and (S)-omeprazole in PMs were significantly higher than those in hmEMs and htEMs, and similar results were obtained in the case of omeprazole sulfone. Additionally, there was a significant difference in plasma concentrations of (R)-5-hydroxyomeprazole among CYP2C19 genotype groups, whereas no significant differences were observed in that of (S)-5-hydroxyomeprazole.

Patients aged >70\u00a0years who received at least two prescriptions for donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine between January 2006 and December 2010 were included in the study. Rates of dose-maximisation were recorded by examining the initiation dose of each AD drug commenced during the study period and any subsequent dose titrations. Non-persistence was defined by a gap in prescribing of more than 63 consecutive days. Predictors of dose-maximisation and non-persistence were also analysed. RESULTS: Between January 2006 and December 2010, 20,729 patients aged >70\u00a0years received a prescription for an AD medication. Despite most patients on donepezil and memantine receiving a prescription for the maximum drug dose, this dose was maintained for 2 consecutive months in only two-thirds of patients. Patients were significantly more likely to have their doses of donepezil and memantine maximised if prescribed in more recent years (2010 vs. 2007). Rates of non-persistence were 30.1\u00a0% at 6 months and 43.8\u00a0% at 12\u00a0months.

It was found that GTS treatment significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, accompanied by a significant increase in glucose-induced GLP1 secretion and upregulation of proglucagon gene expression. Data from NCI-H716 cells showed that both GTS and Rb1 promoted GLP1 secretion. It was observed that Rb1 increased the ratio of intracellular ATP to ADP concentration and intracellular Ca(2)(+) concentration. The metabolic inhibitor azide (3\u200amM), the KATP channel opener diazoxide (340\u200a\u03bcM), and the Ca(2)(+) channel blocker nifedipine (20\u200a\u03bcM) significantly reversed Rb1-mediated GLP1 secretion. All these results drew a conclusion that ginsenosides stimulated GLP1 secretion both in vivo and in vitro. The antidiabetic effects of ginsenosides may be a result of enhanced GLP1 secretion.", "anno": [[56, 57, true], [203, 204, true], [357, 358, true], [496, 497, true], [643, 644, true], [745, 746, true], [821, 822, true], [1032, 1033, true], [1111, 1112, true], [1240, 1241, true], [1426, 1427, true], [1533, 1534, true], [1618, 1619, true]]}, {"id": 23444429, "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is implicated in liver cancer. The aim of this study was to find out whether HBV or its components [HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV core protein (HBc), and HBV X protein (HBx)] could interfere with the host DNA damage response and repair pathway. The full HBV genome or individual HBV open-reading frame (ORF) was introduced into HepG2 cells to examine the effect on host genomic stability, DNA repair efficacy in response to double-strand DNA damage, and DNA damage-induced cell death. Responses to apoptosis induction in the HBV ORF-transfected HepG2 cells were also compared with those in HBV-positive and HBV-negative human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In the absence of HBV replication, accumulation of HBsAg in liver cells without other HBV proteins enhanced DNA repair protein and tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) degradation, which resulted in resistance to apoptosis induction and deficient double-strand DNA repair. However, HBsAg-positive cells exhibited increased cell death with exposure to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that blocks single-strand DNA repair. These results indicate that suppression of PML by HBsAg disrupts cellular mechanisms that respond to double-strand DNA damage for DNA repair or apoptosis induction, which may facilitate hepatocarcinogenesis and open up a synthetic lethality strategy for HBsAg-positive HCC treatment.-Chung, Y.-L.

Fanconi anemia (FA), is a rare cancer susceptibility syndrome with an incidence of only 1 per 350,000 births. FA is an autosomal recessive disease with three main features: chromosome instability, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), cisplatin and so on, and susceptible to a number of cancer types, mainly leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck or gynecologic system. DNA crosslinking agents may led to DNA cross-linking lesion, and Fanconi anemia pathway plays a key role in repairing its cross-linking.

Then, we determined whether DA-3091 has the potency as a drug for the treatment of metabolic disease. In obese mice, after 8-week treatment, the body weight gain was significantly more suppressed by both 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg of DA-3091, monthly subcutaneous administered, than by 10 mg/kg/day of sibutramin, a drug against obesity. In NAFLD mice, a significant reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, representative markers of hepatic injury, was observed after biweekly subcutaneous administration of 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg of DA-3091 for 8 weeks. A significant reduction in hepatic lipid accumulation was observed in DA-3091 treated groups as well.
