In the present study, primary cultured DRG neurons were used to determine the effects of IGF-1 on neurochemical phenotypes of the neurons with excitotoxicity induced by glutamate (Glu). DRG neurons were dissociated and cultured for 48 hours and then exposed to IGF-1 (20 nmol/L), Glu (0.2 mmol/L), Glu (0.2 mmol/L) plus IGF-1 (20 nmol/L) for additional 24 hours. The DRG neurons were continuously exposed to culture media as control. After that, all above cultured DRG neurons were processed for detecting mRNA levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and neurofilament-200 (NF-200) by real time-PCR analysis. CGRP and NF-200 expression in situ was determined by fluorescent labeling technique. The results showed that CGRP mRNA, but not NF-200 mRNA, increased after IGF-1 administration in the absence or presence of Glu. IGF-1 could increase the percentage of CGRP-expressing neurons, but not NF-200-expressing neurons, in the absence or presence of Glu.

The discovery of Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) has ignited a new surge of cAMP-related research and has depicted novel cAMP properties independent of protein kinase A and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. The multidomain architecture of Epac determines its activity state and allows cell-type specific protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions that control fine-tuning of pivotal biologic responses through the \"old\" second messenger cAMP. Compartmentalization of cAMP in space and time, maintained by A-kinase anchoring proteins, phosphodiesterases, and \u03b2-arrestins, contributes to the Epac signalosome of small GTPases, phospholipases, mitogen- and lipid-activated kinases, and transcription factors.

Phylogenetic analysis predicts that most marapsins are transmembrane proteins.

Spermatids are also transported back-and-forth across the seminiferous epithelium during the epithelial cycle until they line up at the luminal edge of the tubule to prepare for spermiation at stage VIII of the cycle. Spermatid transport thus requires the intricate coordination of the cytoskeletons in Sertoli cells (SCs) as spermatids are nonmotile cells lacking the ultrastructures of lamellipodia and filopodia, as well as the organized components of the cytoskeletons. In the course of preparing this brief review, we were surprised to see that, except for some earlier eminent morphological studies, little is known about the regulation of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton and the coordination of MT with the actin-based cytoskeleton to regulate spermatid transport during the epithelia cycle, illustrating that this is a largely neglected area of research in the field.

Therefore, concern about TH disruption (THD) has resulted in strategies being developed to identify THD chemicals (THDCs). Information on potential of chemicals causing THD is typically derived from animal studies. For the majority of chemicals, however, this information is either limited or unavailable. It is also unlikely that animal experiments will be performed for all THD relevant chemicals in the near future for ethical, financial and practical reasons. In addition, typical animal experiments often do not provide information on the mechanism of action of THDC, making it harder to extrapolate results across species. Relevant effects may not be identified in animal studies when the effects are delayed, life stage specific, not assessed by the experimental paradigm (e.g., behaviour) or only occur when an organism has to adapt to environmental factors by modulating TH levels. Therefore, in vitro and in silico alternatives to identify THDC and quantify their potency are needed. THDC have many potential mechanisms of action, including altered hormone production, transport, metabolism, receptor activation and disruption of several feed-back mechanisms. In vitro assays are available for many of these endpoints, and the application of modern '-omics' technologies, applicable for in vivo studies can help to reveal relevant and possibly new endpoints for inclusion in a targeted THDC in vitro test battery. Within the framework of the ASAT initiative (Assuring Safety without Animal Testing), an international group consisting of experts in the areas of thyroid endocrinology, toxicology of endocrine disruption, neurotoxicology, high-throughput screening, computational biology, and regulatory affairs has reviewed the state of science for (1) known mechanisms for THD plus examples of THDC; (2) in vitro THD tests currently available or under development related to these mechanisms; and (3) in silico methods for estimating the blood levels of THDC. Based on this scientific review, the panel has recommended a battery of test methods to be able to classify chemicals as of less or high concern for further hazard and risk assessment for THD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In BE experiments, four groups were used: rats fed normally and not stressed or stressed, rats exposed to cycles of restriction/refeeding and then stressed, or not stressed. In the other experiments, two groups were used: rats exposed or not to food restriction. RESULTS: Only restricted and stressed rats exhibited BE for HPF (containing chocolate cream). Intracerebroventricular injections of N/OFQ of 0.5\u00a0nmol/rat significantly reduced BE. N/OFQ 1\u00a0nmol/rat did not reduce BE but significantly increased HPF intake following food restrictions.

Detection and identification of phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues in a globular protein, while mostly occurring in solvent-exposed flexible loops, does not lead to chemical shift changes as obvious as in disordered proteins and hence does not necessarily shift the resonances outside the spectrum of the folded protein. Other complications were encountered to characterize the extent of the phosphorylation, as part of the (1)H,(15)N amide resonances around the phosphorylation site are specifically broadened in the unphosphorylated state. Despite these obstacles, NMR spectroscopy was an efficient tool to confirm phosphorylation on S16 of the WW domain and to quantify the level of phosphorylation.

A reduced conformational heterogeneity and flexibility of the phospho-binding loop upon S16 phosphorylation could account for part of the decreased affinity for its phosphorylated partner.

Co-administration of RSG and ALN prevented the bone loss associated with RSG treatment. Following cessation of RSG treatment, effects on bone mass and strength showed evidence of reversal. Thus, treatment of OVX rats with RSG results in loss of bone mass and strength, primarily at sites rich in trabecular bone mainly due to increased bone resorption. These effects can be prevented by concomitant treatment with ALN and may be reversed following discontinuation of RSG. \u00a9 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "anno": [[139, 140, true], [442, 443, true], [510, 511, true], [658, 659, true], [707, 708, true], [823, 824, true], [947, 948, true], [1032, 1033, true], [1104, 1105, true], [1278, 1279, true], [1400, 1401, true], [1488, 1489, true], [1589, 1590, true], [1753, 1754, true], [1872, 1873, true], [1927, 1928, true]]}, {"id": 23456978, "text": "The further development in research of bone regeneration is necessary to meet the clinical demand for bone reconstruction.

In our previous studies, we identified several 6-NC-derived DNA adducts in the rat mammary gland; one major adduct was derived from (\u00b1)-trans-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydro-6-nitrochrysene (1,2-DHD-6-NC). In the present study, we resolved the racemic (\u00b1)-1,2-DHD-6-NC into (-)-[R,R]- and (+)-[S,S]-1,2-DHD-6-NC and compared their in vivo mutagenicity and carcinogenicity in the mammary glands of female transgenic (BigBlue F344 \u00d7 Sprague-Dawley)F1 rats harboring lacI/cII and Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. Both [R,R]- and [S,S]-isomers exerted similar mutagenicity and carcinogenicity but were less potent than 6-NC. Additional in vivo and in vitro studies were then performed to explore possible mechanisms that can explain the higher potency of 6-NC than 1,2-DHD-6-NC. Using ELISA, we found that neither 6-NC nor 1,2-DHD-6-NC increased the levels of several inflammatory cytokines in plasma obtained from rats 24 h after treatment. In MCF-7 cells, as determined by immunoblotting, the effects of 6-NC and 1,2-DHD-6-NC on protein expression (p53, Akt, p38, JNK, c-myc, bcl-2, PCNA, and ER\u03b2) were comparable; however, the expressions of AhR and ER\u03b1 proteins were decreased by 6-NC but not 1,2-DHD-6-NC. The expression of both receptors was decreased in mammary tissues of rats treated with 6-NC. Our findings suggest that the differential effects of 6-NC and 1,2-DHD-6-NC on AhR and ER\u03b1 could potentially account for the higher carcinogenicity of 6-NC in the rat mammary gland.", "anno": [[154, 155, true], [354, 355, true], [660, 661, true], [771, 772, true], [925, 926, true], [1088, 1089, true], [1357, 1358, true], [1450, 1451, true], [1632, 1633, true]]}]}
