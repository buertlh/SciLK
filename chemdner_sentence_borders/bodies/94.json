Extensive neural suppression of the extrajunctional ColQ expression in regenerating fast muscles during maturation is a very slow process requiring 30-60days. If the immature regenerating fast EDL muscles were indirectly or directly electrically stimulated immediately after innervation by chronic low-frequency impulse pattern for 8days, no significant increase of the extrajunctional ColQ mRNA levels was observed in stimulated regenerates in comparison to non-stimulated ones.

To overcome this problem, we have developed a bioreductive prodrug, which functions as a Chk1/Aurora A inhibitor specifically in hypoxic conditions.

There is an urgent need to understand and predict the effect of single and multiple stressors on ecosystem service delivery across different spatial scales (local to global), to develop indicators that can be used to quantify and map services and identify synergies and trade-offs between them, to establish protection goals and restoration targets defined in terms of the types and levels of service delivery required, and to develop approaches for the assessment and management of chemical risk to ecosystem services that consider the whole life cycle of products and processes.

Areas covered: Carbonic anhydrases (EC 4.2.1.1) are ubiquitous metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration/dehydration of CO2/HCO3 (-), respectively. CA inhibitors (CAIs) such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, topiramate, zonisamide, and sulthiame can reduce seizures through perturbation of the CO2 equilibrium and/or the inhibition of ion channels. This review focuses on the mechanism of epilepsy, CA catalysis, and recent developments in the treatment of epilepsy using CAIs. Expert opinion: Based on the observed active-site binding interactions of CAIs in crystal structures and their respective inhibition constants, structure-activity relationships can be mapped.

We previously found that the Akt/PKB ortholog AKT-1 dampens the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress in the germline by negatively regulating the p53-like transcription factor CEP-1. Here, we report unexpected rearrangements to the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, whereby the insulin-like receptor DAF-2 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK-1 oppose AKT-1 to promote DNA damage-induced apoptosis. While DNA damage does not affect phosphorylation at the PDK-1 site Thr350/Thr308 of AKT-1, it increased phosphorylation at Ser517/Ser473. Although ablation of daf-2 or pdk-1 completely suppressed akt-1-dependent apoptosis, the transcriptional activation of CEP-1 was unaffected, suggesting that daf-2 and pdk-1 act independently or downstream of cep-1 and akt-1. Ablation of the akt-1 paralog akt-2 or the downstream target of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway daf-16 (a FOXO transcription factor) restored sensitivity to damage-induced apoptosis in daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants. In addition, daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants have reduced levels of phospho-MPK-1/ERK in their germ cells, indicating that the insulin/IGF-1 pathway promotes Ras signaling in the germline. Ablation of the Ras effector gla-3, a negative regulator of mpk-1, restored sensitivity to apoptosis in daf-2 mutants, suggesting that gla-3 acts downstream of daf-2. In addition, the hypersensitivity of let-60/Ras gain-of-function mutants to damage-induced apoptosis was suppressed to wild-type levels by ablation of daf-2.

This variant has two sub variants, and one is regarded as a more aggressive form in comparison to the more common classical and follicular variants.

CDX2, a transcription factor of the caudal homeobox family, plays a key role in intestinal development and differentiation and it is widely used as a marker to detect adenocarcinoma of intestinal and colonic origin. CDX2 has been rarely reported in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Methods: We studied ten cases of columnar cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The histological, architectural, and cytological features fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the columnar cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma as defined by the current WHO classification. Ten patients (6M : 4F) ranging from 32 to 90 years of age (mean 58.3 years) presented with tumors classified as indolent (4 cases) or aggressive (6 cases); 3 with BRAFV600E mutation.

Results: Nuclear positivity for CDX2 was detected in one out of the ten cases studied (10%); the other nine cases did not express CDX2.

Patients who receive insulin treatment are typically older and \"sicker\" than those who receive oral agents.

The hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia and IGF-1 receptor activation promote cancer is strong, but confounded by the association of hyperinsulinemia with obesity, which separately promotes malignancy.

We sought to identify genomic regions potentially harboring such oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, and to gain insight into the origins and molecular relationship of malignant versus benign parathyroid tumors. We performed genome-wide copy-number and loss of heterozygosity analysis using Affymetrix 50K SNP mapping arrays and/or comparative genomic hybridization on 16 primary parathyroid carcinomas, local recurrences or distant metastases, and matched normal controls, from 10 individuals.

Recurrent allelic gains were seen on chromosomes 1q and 16, suggesting the presence of parathyroid oncogenes on these chromosomes. Importantly, the most common alteration in benign parathyroid adenomas, loss of 11q, was not found as a recurrent change in the malignant parathyroid tissues. Molecular allelotyping using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers provided further confirmation that the prevalence of 11q loss is markedly and significantly lower in carcinomas as compared with adenomas.

Production of these new products is expected to meet worldwide demand, promote market competition, maintain the incentives for innovation, and sustain the healthcare systems. The licencing of these products, however, relies on the experience gained with the original biopharmaceuticals. Critical issues related to this class of medicinal products include their terminology (to avoid confusion with generics and non-innovator copy versions that have not been tested according to the biosimilar guidelines), manufacturing, and regulation. The European Union (EU) has been the first to establish a regulatory framework for marketing authorization application (MAA) and has named these products biosimilars, a term also recently adopted by the US FDA. Unlike the conventional, more common small molecular weight human medicines and chemical generics, protein-based medicines exhibit higher molecular weight, complexity in structure and function that can be affected by changes in the manufacturing process. Therefore, biosimilars represent a relatively heterogeneous class of medicinal products that make their regulation quite challenging. According to the current understanding in the EU, a biosimilar is a copy version of an already authorized biopharmaceutical (or reference product) with similar biologic activity, physicochemical characteristics, efficacy, and safety, based on a full comparability exercise at quality, preclinical and clinical level to ensure similar efficacy and safety. Guidance has been provided through several Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidelines as well as individual scientific advice requested from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by various companies for the development and regulation of biosimilars.

In this study we identified patients for whom known drug and pathological causes of levothyroxine malabsorption were excluded and despite often high doses of levothyroxine, the patients remained hypothyroid. DESIGN: Using a weight-determined oral levothyroxine bolus administration, absorption was initially assessed in twenty-three patients. In nearly all patients this was shown to be maximal at 120mins post ingestion. This was then followed by the continued administration of a weekly thyroxine bolus for a four-week period after which TSH and free T4 levels were recorded. RESULTS: All patients showed a rise in free T4 at 120mins following the administration of the levothyroxine bolus, with a mean increase of 54\u00b1 3% from baseline. Following the treatment period, using an equivalent weekly levothyroxine dose which was significantly less than that of the daily dose taken by the patients before the test, the TSH reduced from baseline in ~75% of cases.

The embryotoxicity of these chemicals were quantified by considering both the rates of abnormalities and the arrested development or types of abnormalities in D-shaped larvae after 48 h exposure. The success of metamorphosis was examined in pediveliger larvae exposed for 24 h.

The AUC(\u221e) of 100 mg BMS-690514 concomitantly administered with ketoconazole was similar to that of 200 mg BMS-690514 alone. The dose-normalized C(max) and AUC(\u221e) of BMS-690514 from the 100-mg BMS-690514/400-mg ketoconazole treatment increased by 55% and 127%, respectively, relative to those from 200 mg BMS-690514 alone. Prediction of the drug-drug interaction (DDI) using a population-based simulator (Simcyp) indicated that, in addition to CYP3A4 inhibition, the inhibition of P-gp by ketoconazole in the intestine, liver, and kidneys must be invoked to fully account for the DDI observed. This finding suggests that the inhibition of P-gp by ketoconazole, along with its effect on CYP3A4, needs to be considered when designing a DDI study of ketoconazole with a victim drug that is a dual substrate.", "anno": [[154, 155, true], [273, 274, true], [331, 332, true], [535, 536, true], [660, 661, true], [858, 859, true], [1129, 1130, true], [1340, 1341, true]]}, {"id": 22899728, "text": "We investigated the effect of copper (Cu) overload (20-160 \u00b5M/24 h) in two cell lines of human hepatic (HepG2) and pulmonary (A-549) origin by determining lipid and protein damage and the response of the antioxidant defence system. A-549 cells were more sensitive to Cu overload than HepG2 cells. A marked increase was observed in both the cell lines in the nitrate plus nitrite concentration, protein carbonyls and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS).

To assess the contribution of different immune cell populations to the immunomodulatory fatty acid effect, we comparatively investigated several aspects of inflammation in human T-helper (Th) cells and monocytes. Both fatty acids, but DHA to a lesser extent compared with EPA, selectively and dose-dependently reduced the percentage of cytokine-expressing Th cells in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3-dependent fashion, whereas the expression of the cell surface marker CD69 was unaltered on activated T cells. In monocytes, both EPA and DHA increased interleukin (IL)-10 without affecting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-6. Cellular incorporation of EPA and DHA occurred mainly at the expense of arachidonic acid. Concomitantly, thromboxane B (TXB)2 and leukotriene B (LTB)4 in supernatants decreased, while levels of TXB3 and LTB5 increased. This increase was independent of activation and in accordance with cyclooxygenase expression patterns in monocytes. Moreover, EPA and DHA gave rise to a variety of mono- and trihydroxy derivatives of highly anti-inflammatory potential, such as resolvins and their precursors. Our results suggest that EPA and DHA do not generally affect immune cell functions in an inhibitory manner but rather promote pro-resolving responses.", "anno": [[207, 208, true], [420, 421, true], [738, 739, true], [857, 858, true], [947, 948, true], [1076, 1077, true], [1192, 1193, true], [1352, 1353, true], [1503, 1504, true]]}, {"id": 23334090, "text": "We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to show that a DNA-like double helix of two poly(acetylene) (PA) chains can form inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). The computational results indicate that SWNTs can activate and guide the self-assembly of polymer chains, allowing them to adopt a helical configuration in a SWNT through the combined action of the van der Waals potential well and the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between the polymer and the inner surface of SWNTs. Meanwhile both the SWNT size and polymer chain stiffness determine the outcome of the nanostructure. Furthermore, we also found that water clusters encourage the self-assembly of PA helical structures in the tube. This molecular model may lead to a better understanding of the formation of a double helix biological molecule inside SWNTs. Alternatively, it could form the basis of a novel nanoscale material by utilizing the 'empty' spaces of SWNTs.", "anno": [[169, 170, true], [481, 482, true], [582, 583, true], [695, 696, true], [820, 821, true], [931, 932, true]]}, {"id": 23604005, "text": "By means of first-principles calculations combined with the tight-binding approximation, the strain-induced semiconductor-semimetal transition in graphdiyne is discovered. It is shown that the band gap of graphdiyne increases from 0.47 eV to 1.39 eV with increasing the biaxial tensile strain, while the band gap decreases from 0.47 eV to nearly zero with increasing the uniaxial tensile strain, and Dirac cone-like electronic structures are observed. The uniaxial strain-induced changes of the electronic structures of graphdiyne come from the breaking of geometrical symmetry that lifts the degeneracy of energy bands.
