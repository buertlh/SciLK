METHODS: Adult mice were divided into susceptible and unsusceptible groups after 10\u00a0days of social defeat stress. In experiment 1, behavioral tests were conducted, and brains were processed for Western blotting at day 27 after stress. In experiment 2, social avoidance tests were conducted, and brains were processed for Western blotting at day 12 after stress. RESULTS: The results indicate decreased and increased locomotion and anxiety behavior in all defeated mice. Decrease in social interaction, increased immobility, and impaired memory performance were only observed in susceptible mice. A decrease in the Chat level at days 12 and 27 was noted in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (Amyg), and dorsal hippocampus (HIP) in defeated mice.

Drought and heat resulted in the down-regulation of photosynthetic linear electron transport in the leaves, although only a slight decrease in variable fluorescence (Fv)/maximal fluorescence (Fm) was observed, indicating that the chloroplast was protected by mechanisms that dissipate excess excitation energy to prevent damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. The incubation of leaves from unstressed plants under high light intensity resulted in an increase of the activity of electron donation by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ferredoxin to plastoquinone, but no increase was observed in plants exposed to water deficit, suggesting that cyclic electron transport was stimulated by high light only in control plants. In contrast, the activities of the chlororespiration enzymes (NADH dehydrogenase (NDH) complex and plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX)) increased after incubation under high light intensity in leaves of the water deficit plants, but not in control plants, suggesting that chlororespiration was stimulated in stressed plants. The results indicate that the relative importance of chlororespiration and the cyclic electron pathway in the tolerance of photosynthesis to high illumination differs under stress conditions. When plants were not subjected to stress, the contribution of chlororespiration to photosynthetic electron flow regulation was not relevant, and another pathway, such as the ferredoxin-mediated cyclic pathway, was more important.

It is possible that phototoxic drugs promote the development of cutaneous melanoma (CM) by intensifying the effect of ultraviolet light on the skin. We investigated the association between the use of common systemic phototoxic drugs and development of CM. METHODS: This study was a case-control study in a Dutch population-based cohort. The drug dispensing data was obtained from PHARMO, a Dutch drug dispensing and hospital admissions registry, and linked to PALGA, the nationwide pathology network of the Netherlands. The cases were patients diagnosed with pathologically confirmed primary CM between 1991 and 2004. Controls were sampled from the PHARMO population. Exposure to systemic phototoxic drugs was measured and included antimicrobial agents, diuretics, antipsychotic drugs, antidiabetic drugs, cardiac drugs, antimalarials and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to study the association between exposure to phototoxic drugs and CM. RESULTS: The study population included 1,318 cases and 6,786 controls. Any phototoxic drug during the study period was dispensed for 46\u00a0% of the cases and 43\u00a0% of the controls (p\u2009=\u20090.012).

CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the use of phototoxic drugs is associated with an increased risk of developing CM.

In addition to phosphorylation, glycosylation, and palmitoylation, increasing evidence as reviewed here reveals that ubiquitination also regulates the magnitude and temporospatial aspects of GPCR signaling. Posttranslational protein modification by ubiquitin is a key molecular mechanism governing proteins degradation. Ubiquitination mediates the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin, a highly conserved polypeptide of 76 amino acids, to protein substrates. This process is catalyzed by 3 enzymes acting in tandem: an E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; an E2, ubiquitin-carrying enzyme; and an E3, ubiquitin ligase.

The optimal management of late hematologic abnormalities, particularly the use of further treatment with antivenom, has not been well defined. The current FabAV treatment regimen is to give antivenom as a bolus dose over a one-hour period. We describe our experience using a continuous intravenous infusion of FabAV for late hematologic effects and/or associated bleeding complications in rattlesnake envenomation. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational case series of patients envenomated by North American rattlesnakes at three medical centers managed with a continuous intravenous infusion of FabAV for late hematologic abnormalities and/or associated bleeding complications. Indications, dilution and infusion protocols, and duration of therapy were individualized. RESULTS: Five cases were identified between July 2010 and September 2011. All patients had profound late hematologic abnormalities and/or were associated with bleeding complications. Several patients had received repeat bolus infusions of FabAV, with or without human blood products, with either inadequate or only transient beneficial response. All patients were then managed with a continuous intravenous infusion of FabAV and all appeared to respond to the continuous intravenous infusion of FabAV, titrated to effect, with cessation of progression and, in most cases, improvement in hematologic abnormalities. Rates of infusion varied from 2 to 4 vials per 24\u00a0h (mean\u00a0=\u00a03.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 vials/day). The termination of FabAV infusion was between day 6 and day 14 from the time of envenomation (mean\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 days), after which hematologic values were normalized or were normalizing in all patients and continued to do so. DISCUSSION: The use of FabAV as a continuous intravenous infusion, particularly after the acute phase of envenomation has passed, provides a continuous source of circulating antibodies to neutralize venom components reaching circulation from tissue stores and allows natural replenishment of hematologic factors such as platelets and/or fibrinogen. This method is an efficient use of FabAV, avoiding the wasteful excess of a bolus dose, may be more effective, eliminating the potential for destruction of hematologic factors when protective antivenom levels are lost between bolus FabAV doses, and appears to be safe. Further assessments of the stability and sterility of the product during infusion are needed. The need to continue hospitalization is the major drawback, but continued observation and inpatient care may be needed for other indications (e.g. bleeding) in this subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS: A continuous intravenous infusion of FabAV between 2 and 4 vials per day, titrated to effect, and continued for 6-14 days post-envenomation appeared to be associated with reversal of late hematologic effects of rattlesnake envenomation and, when combined with indicated human blood products, control of significant bleeding.

Our previous study reported that a nutrient antioxidant, myo-inositol (MI), can protect fish from Cu-induced oxidative injury; however, the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze potential pathways. First, to investigate the hypothesis that MI protects enterocytes against Cu toxicity via the intercept pathway, enterocytes were treated with different concentrations of MI (0-75mg/L medium) in the presence of 6mg/L of Cu for 24h (Experiment 1). Next, we investigated the potential reparative role of MI after a Cu challenge (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 1 indicated that cells exposed to Cu alone for 24h exhibited increases in lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and protein oxidation (P<0.05). Notably, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on LDH release was observed with all doses of MI. Moreover, co-treatment with MI completely inhibited Cu-induced protein carbonyl (PC) formation. However, Cu-induced lipid peroxidation was not altered by MI co-treatment. Additionally, Cu exposure suppressed total-superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), CuZnSOD and catalase (CAT) activities, and these changes were completely blocked by co-treatment with sufficient MI concentrations. In contrast, cells exposed to Cu exhibited adaptive increases in reduced glutathione (GSH) content and the activities of anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR). Interestingly, the Cu-stimulated increases in these antioxidants were blocked by co-treatment with sufficient MI concentrations. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that cell injury (LDH release), lipid peroxidation (MDA formation) and protein oxidation induced by Cu were reversed by subsequent MI treatment. Meanwhile, Cu-induced decreases in alkaline phosphatase (AKP), anti-superoxide anion (ASA), T-SOD and CuZnSOD activities were completely restored by subsequent MI treatment, while the reduced CAT activity was partially restored. However, MI rescues partially restored the adaptive increase in GPx activity induced by Cu, whereas the adaptive increase in reduced GSH content was completely reversed by 75mg/L of MI. However, subsequent MI treatments did not alter the induction of GST activity by Cu. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that MI not only protected enterocytes from Cu-induced oxidative damage but also increased the repair activity in primary enterocytes after challenge with Cu.

The protein content ranged 27.2-31.5g/100g for flour and 58.8-61.1% for PRMP. Processing flour into PRMP led to a significant (p<0.05) reduction of tannins (50%), total polyphenols (50%) and trypsin inhibitors (94%). The rats fed PMRP diets witnessed weight gain similar to casein, while those fed mucuna flour lost weight. The levels of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol observed in animals groups fed mucuna flour and PRMP were significantly lower (p<0.05) than the control group. In addition lymphocytes, granulocytes, red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit of rats fed mucuna flour were significantly (p<0.05) lower than values in other rats groups. Kidneys glomerular sclerosis and high creatinine levels were observed in group fed mucuna flour. PRMP then represents a good alternative of using mucuna proteins for human nutrition.", "anno": [[150, 151, true], [286, 287, true], [407, 408, true], [546, 547, true], [624, 625, true], [763, 764, true], [870, 871, true], [1050, 1051, true], [1225, 1226, true], [1322, 1323, true], [1408, 1409, true]]}, {"id": 23474356, "text": "Macrolones are a new class of antimicrobial compounds consisting of a macrolide scaffold linked to a 4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid moiety via C(4\u2033) position of a macrolide. As macrolides are known to possess favorable pharmacokinetic properties by accumulating in inflammatory cells, in this study we determined the intensity of accumulation in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) of 57 compounds of the macrolone class and analyzed the relationship between the molecular structure and this cellular pharmacokinetic property. Accumulation of macrolones ranged from 0 to 5.5-fold higher than the standard macrolide azithromycin. Distinct structural features in all three considered molecule parts: the macrolide scaffold, quinolone moiety and the linker, affect cellular accumulation. Interestingly, while the parent macrolide, azithromycin, accumulates approximately 3-fold more than clarithromycin, among macrolones all clarithromycin derivatives accumulated in PMNs significantly more than their azithromycin counterparts. Modeling cellular accumulation of macrolones with simple molecular descriptors, as well as with the measured octanol-water distribution coefficient, revealed that the number of hydrogen bond donors and secondary amide groups negatively contribute to macrolone accumulation, while lipophilicity makes a positive contribution.", "anno": [[171, 172, true], [530, 531, true], [632, 633, true], [788, 789, true], [1029, 1030, true], [1354, 1355, true]]}, {"id": 23474357, "text": "A vast number of variations in drug/vehicle combinations may come into contact with skin. Evaluating the effect of potential drug, vehicle and skin interactions for all possible combinations is a daunting task. A practical solution is a rapid screening technique amenable to high throughput approaches (e.g. 96-well plates). In this study, three artificial membranes (isopropyl myristate (IPM), certramides and Strat-M\u2122) were evaluated for their ability to predict the skin permeability of caffeine, cortisone, diclofenac sodium, mannitol, salicylic acid and testosterone applied in propylene glycol, water and ethanol as unsaturated and saturated concentrations. Resultant absorption data was compared to porcine skin diffusion cell data. The correlations (r(2)) between membrane and diffusion cell data from saturated and unsaturated concentrations were 0.38, 0.47 and 0.56 for the Strat-M\u2122, certramide and IPM membranes, respectively. This relationship improved when only saturated concentrations were evaluated (r(2)=0.60, 0.63 and 0.66 for the Strat-M\u2122, certramide and IPM membranes, respectively). A correlation between membrane retention and the amount remaining in skin had r(2) values of 0.73 (Strat-M\u2122), 0.67 (certramides), and 0.67 (IPM). Quantitative structure-permeability relationship models for each membrane identified different physicochemical factors influencing the absorption process. Although further investigations exploring complex topical formulations are required, these results suggest potential use as an initial screening approach to assist in narrowing the selection of formulations to be evaluated with a more biologically intact model, thereby assisting in the development of new topical formulations.", "anno": [[88, 89, true], [209, 210, true], [323, 324, true], [662, 663, true], [738, 739, true], [936, 937, true], [1102, 1103, true], [1248, 1249, true], [1403, 1404, true], [1731, 1732, true]]}]}
