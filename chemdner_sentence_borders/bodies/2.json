Two main classes of optogenetic tools allow to either depolarize or hyperpolarize, and respectively generate or inhibit action potentials in selective populations of neurons. This opens unprecedented possibilities for delineating the role of certain neuronal populations in brain processing and diseases. Moreover, optogenetics may be considered for developing potential treatment strategies for brain diseases, particularly for excitability disorders such as epilepsy. Expression of the inhibitory halorhodopsin NpHR in hippocampal principal cells has been recently used as a tool to effectively control chemically and electrically induced epileptiform activity in slice preparations, and to reduce in vivo spiking induced by tetanus toxin injection in the motor cortex. In this review we give a comprehensive summary of what has been achieved so far in the field of epilepsy using optogenetics, and discuss some of the possible strategies that could be envisaged in the future. We also point out some of the challenges and pitfalls in relation to possible outcomes of using optogenetics for controlling network excitability, and associated brain diseases.

We have shown previously that potentiation of mGlu1 receptors reduces spontaneous occurring spike and wave discharges (SWDs) in the WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy, whereas activation of mGlu2/3 and mGlu4 receptors produces the opposite effect. Here, we have extended the study to mGlu5 receptors, which are known to be highly expressed within the cortico-thalamo-cortical network. We used presymptomatic and symptomatic WAG/Rij rats and aged-matched ACI rats. WAG/Rij rats showed a reduction in the mGlu5 receptor protein levels and in the mGlu5-receptor mediated stimulation of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in the ventrobasal thalamus, whereas the expression of mGlu5 receptors was increased in the somatosensory cortex. Interestingly, these changes preceded the onset of the epileptic phenotype, being already visible in pre-symptomatic WAG/Rij rats. SWDs in symptomatic WAG/Rij rats were not influenced by pharmacological blockade of mGlu5 receptors with MTEP (10 or 30 mg/kg, i.p.), but were significantly decreased by mGlu5 receptor potentiation with the novel enhancer, VU0360172 (3 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.), without affecting motor behaviour. The effect of VU0360172 was prevented by co-treatment with MTEP. These findings suggest that changes in mGlu5 receptors might lie at the core of the absence-seizure prone phenotype of WAG/Rij rats, and that mGlu5 receptor enhancers are potential candidates to the treatment of absence epilepsy.

RTT causes a wide variety of debilitating symptoms and no cure currently exists. Mouse models bearing mutations in the Mecp2 gene recapitulate most physiological and behavioural RTT-related abnormalities. Stimulating neonatal environments (e.g. brief maternal separations or maternal low-dose corticosterone supplementation) reduce stress and fear responses at adulthood. The present study investigated whether impacting early in development the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, by exposing Mecp2-308 mutant pups to a low dose of corticosterone (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, during the 1st week of life) may contrast RTT-related abnormalities in neuroendocrine regulation and behavioural adaptation at adulthood. In line with previous reports, when fully symptomatic, MeCP2-308 mice showed a reduction in the regular nocturnal hyperactivity in the home-cage and increased anxiety-like behaviours and plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels in response to restraint stress. An abnormal elevation in mRNA levels of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and BDNF gene was also evident in the hippocampus of fully symptomatic mutant mice. Neonatal CORT modulated MR gene expression and behavioural reactivity towards a novel object, also restoring wt-like levels of locomotor/exploratory behaviour in mutant mice. Enhanced sensitivity to the neonatal treatment (in terms of increase in GR and MR mRNA levels), was also evident in the hippocampus of MeCP2-308 mice compared to wt littermates. Present results corroborate the hypothesis that targeting the glucocorticoid system may prove valid in contrasting at least some of the RTT-related symptoms and provide evidence that pharmacological interventions during critical early time windows can persistently improve the behavioural phenotype of RTT mice. Current data also support the emerging role played by Mecp2 in mediating the epigenetic programming induced by early life events and indicate that, in the absence of functional MeCP2, programming of the central nervous system in response to early environmental stimuli is abnormally regulated.

The conditioned place preference (CPP) behavioral model is a useful paradigm for studying the ability of these drug predictive stimuli to reinstate drug-seeking behavior. The present study investigated the dose-dependent effects of D-serine (10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) on extinction training and drug-primed reinstatement in cocaine-conditioned rats. In the first experiment, D-serine had no effect on the acquisition or development of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization or CPP. In the second experiment, D-serine treatment resulted in significantly decreased time spent in the drug-paired compartment following completion of an extinction protocol. A cocaine-primed reinstatement test indicated that the combination of extinction training along with D-serine treatment resulted in a significant reduction of drug-seeking behavior. The third experiment assessed D-serine's long-term effects to diminish drug-primed reinstatement. D-serine treatment given during extinction was effective in reducing drug-seeking for more than four weeks of abstinence after the last cocaine exposure.

Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom of MS which is unrelated to its clinical form, stage of development, the degree of disability, or the lesion load on magnetic resonance imaging. Fatigue in MS is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and autonomic dysfunction. Recently it has been reported that the wakefulness-promoting drug modafinil may relieve fatigue in MS patients and ameliorate the associated cognitive difficulties. However, it is not clear to what extent the anti-fatigue effect of modafinil may be related to its alerting and sympathetic activating effects. We addressed this question by comparing three groups of subjects, MS patients with fatigue, MS patients without fatigue and healthy controls, matched for age and sex, on measures of alertness (self-ratings on the Epworth and Stanford Sleepiness Scales and on a battery of visual analogue scales; critical flicker fusion frequency; Pupillographic Sleepiness Test; choice reaction time) and autonomic function (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter), and by examining the effect of a single dose (200 mg) of modafinil on these measures. MS patients with fatigue, compared with healthy controls, had reduced level of alertness on all the tests used; MS patients without fatigue did not differ from healthy controls. MS patients with fatigue had a reduced level of cardiovascular sympathetic activation compared to the other two groups. Modafinil displayed alerting and sympathomimetic effects in all three groups of subjects. As fatigue in MS is associated with reduced levels of alertness and sympathetic activity, modafinil may exert its anti-fatigue effect in MS by correcting these deficiencies. The anti-fatigue effect of modafinil may reflect the activation of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC), since there is evidence that this wakefulness-promoting nucleus is damaged in MS, and that modafinil, probably via the dopaminergic system, can stimulate the LC.

The selective group I agonist DHPG (10 \u03bcM) produced an inward current in all PAG neurons tested which was associated with a near parallel shift in the current-voltage relationship. By contrast, the group II and III mGlu receptor agonists DCG-IV (1 \u03bcM) and l-AP4 (3 \u03bcM) produced an outward current in only 10-20% of PAG neurons tested. The DHPG induced current was concentration dependent (EC(50) = 1.4 \u03bcM), was reduced by the mGlu1 antagonist CPCCOEt (100 \u03bcM), and was further reduced by CPCCOEt in combination with the mGlu5 antagonist MPEP (10 \u03bcM).

However, treatment with common therapies such as insulin or insulinotrophic sulphonylureas (SU), while effective in reducing hyperglycaemia, may impose a greater risk of hypoglycaemia, as neither therapy is self-regulated by ambient blood glucose concentrations. Hypoglycaemia has been associated with adverse physical and psychological outcomes and may contribute to negative cardiovascular events; hence minimization of hypoglycaemia risk is clinically advantageous. Stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells by glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists is known to be glucose-dependent. GLP-1R agonists potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and have little or no activity on insulin secretion in the absence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. This 'glucose-regulated' activity of GLP-1R agonists makes them useful and potentially safer therapeutics for overall glucose control compared to non-regulated therapies; hyperglycaemia can be reduced with minimal hypoglycaemia. While the inherent mechanism of action of GLP-1R agonists mediates their glucose dependence, studies in rats suggest that SUs may uncouple this dependence. This hypothesis is supported by clinical studies showing that the majority of events of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with GLP-1R agonists occur in patients treated with a concomitant SU.

The anticancer activity of the oil extract against human colon (HT-29, Caco-2) and breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines was evaluated using the trypan blue exclusion method and the WST-1 cell proliferation assay. DCOE exhibited antioxidant activity in all assays used.

A significant decrease of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and glutathione (GSH) levels and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) quantity was observed after CCl4 and PC administration alone. PSM pre-treatment decreased serum transaminases and LDH activities and MDA levels and increased the levels of cell protector GSH. Biotransformation phase I enzymes were also assessed in both models. In the CCl4 hepatotoxicity model, pre-treatment with PSM or silymarin resulted in significantly increased activities of ethylmorphine-N-demethylase and aniline 4-hydroxylase activity and cytochrome P450, compared to the CCl4 only group.

At the behavioral level, ATM has been shown to cause improvements on the measures of executive functions, such as response inhibition, working memory and attentional set shifting across different species. However, the exact mechanism of action for ATM's effects on cognition is still not clear. One possible target for the cognitive enhancing effects of ATM is the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC), the only source of NE to key forebrain areas such as cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Although it is known that ATM increases NE availability overall by blocking reuptake of NE, the effects of this agent on impulse activity of LC neurons have not been reported. Here, the effect of ATM (0.1-1 mg/kg, ip) on NE-LC neurons was investigated by recording extracellular activity of LC neurons in isoflurane-anesthetized rats. ATM caused a significant decrease of the tonic activity of LC single-units, although leaving intact the sensory-evoked excitatory component of LC phasic response. Moreover, the magnitude of the inhibitory component of LC response to paw stimulation was increased after 1 mg/kg of ATM and its duration was prolonged at 0.3 mg/kg. Together, these effects of ATM produced an increase in the phasic-to-tonic ratio of LC phasic response to sensory stimulation. ATM also modulated the average sensory-evoked local field potential (LFP) and spike-field coherence in LC depending on the dose tested. The lower dose (0.1 mg/kg) significantly decreased early positive and negative components of the sensory-evoked LFP response. Higher doses (0.3-1 mg/kg) initially increased and then decreased the amplitude of components of the evoked fields, whereas the spike-field coherence was enhanced by 1 mg/kg ATM across frequency bands. Finally, coherence between LC fields and EEG signals was generally increased by 1 mg/kg ATM, whereas 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg respectively decreased and increased coherence values in specific frequency bands. Taken together these results suggest that ATM effects on LC neuronal activity are dose-dependent, with different doses affecting different aspects of LC firing. This modulation of activity of LC-NE neurons may play a role in the cognitive effects of ATM.

The myristoylated \u03b6-pseudosubstrate peptide, ZIP, potently inhibits PKM\u03b6 biochemically in vitro, within cultured cells, and within neurons in hippocampal slices, and reverses LTP maintenance and erases long-term memory storage. A recent study (Wu-Zhang et al., 2012), however, suggested ZIP was not effective on a PKM\u03b6 fusion protein overexpressed in cultured cells. Chelerythrine, a redox-sensitive PKC inhibitor that inhibits PKM\u03b6 and disrupts LTP maintenance and memory storage, was also reported by Wu-Zhang et al. (2012) not to inhibit the expressed PKM\u03b6 fusion protein. However, the efficacy of inhibitors on endogenous enzymes in cells may not be adequately assessed in expression systems in which levels of expression of exogenous enzymes greatly exceed those of endogenous enzymes. Thus, we show, biochemically, that when PKM\u03b6 reaches a level beyond that necessary for substrate phosphorylation such that much of the enzyme is excess or 'spare' kinase, ZIP and chelerythrine do not effectively block substrate phosphorylation. We also show that the cellular overexpression techniques used by Wu-Zhang et al. (2012) increase kinase levels ~30-40 fold above normal levels in transfected cells. Using a mathematical model we show that at such level of overexpression, standard concentrations of inhibitor should have no noticeable effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate the standard concentrations of ZIP, but not scrambled ZIP, inhibit the ability of PKM\u03b6 to potentiate AMPAR responses at postsynaptic sites, the physiological function of the kinase. Wu-Zhang et al. (2012) had also claimed that staurosporine, a general kinase inhibitor that does not effectively inhibit PKM\u03b6 biochemically in vitro, nonetheless indirectly blocked the PKM\u03b6 fusion protein overexpressed in cultured cells by inhibiting phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). However, here we show that staurosporine does not affect PDK1 phosphorylation of the endogenous PKM\u03b6 in hippocampal slices.

We hypothesized that ischemic osteonecrosis leads to early material and mechanical alterations in the bone of the subchondral region. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the bone of the subchondral region for changes in the histology of bone cells, microcrack density, mineral content, and nanoindentation properties at an early stage of ischemic osteonecrosis in a piglet model. This large animal model has been shown to develop a subchondral fracture and femoral head deformity resembling juvenile femoral head osteonecrosis. The unoperated, left femoral head of each piglet (n=8) was used as a normal control, while the right side had a surgical ischemia induced by disrupting the femoral neck vessels with a ligature. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and TUNEL assay were performed on femoral heads from 3 piglets. Quantitative backscattered electron imaging, nanoindentation, and microcrack assessments were performed on the subchondral region of both control and ischemic femoral heads from 5 piglets. H&E staining and TUNEL assay showed extensive cell death and an absence of osteoblasts in the ischemic side compared to the normal control. Microcrack density in the ischemic side (3.2\u00b10.79 cracks/mm(2)) was significantly higher compared to the normal side (0.27\u00b10.27 cracks/mm(2)) in the subchondral region (p<0.05).

A total of 147 day 9.5 embryos were cultivated for 48 h in the standard medium containing 85 % serum. We tested MPA at concentrations of 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 0.75 mg/l (0.31; 0.78; 1.56; 2.34 \u03bcM) and MPA glucuronide at concentrations of 3; 10; 30; 100 mg/l (6.04; 20.14; 60.43; 201.43 \u03bcM).

Therefore, we examined whether the effects of MPA can be enhanced when studied in combination with the glucuronide. Furthermore, the focus was on additional endpoints to the standard evaluation of cultivated embryos, such as development of cranial nerves [trigeminal nerve (V), facial nerve (VII), glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X)] after staining with an antibody against 2H3 neurofilament. Ultrastructural changes were evaluated by electron microscopy. At a concentration of 0.75 mg MPA/l medium, all embryos showed dysmorphic changes. Embryos exposed to 0.25 mg MPA/l medium showed impaired development of nerves, and at 0.1 mg/l, no effects were detectable. Concentration-dependent ultrastructural changes, such as signs of apoptosis, were found by electron microscopy. The examination of the metabolite in this assay showed that at a concentration of 100 mg MPAG/l, the embryos exhibited distinct malformations.

An exponential error model was used to explain intersubject variability and a proportional error model was used to describe residual or intrapatient variability. The final model parameter estimates for the typical (normalised to 70\u2009kg) values of CL and V(d) were 2.31\u2009L/hr and 17.5\u2009L, respectively. The CL and V(d) allometrically increased with weight with the power of 3/4 and 1, respectively. After accounting for weight dependence using the allometric scaling, age, serum creatinine, and gender did not have any influence on model parameters. 4.\u2002The results of this children and adolescent population pharmacokinetic study indicates that etoposide pharmacokinetics were influenced by body weight on an allometric basis. The pharmacokinetic parameters CL and V(d) increased with increasing weight similar to BSA.", "anno": [[114, 115, true], [226, 227, true], [297, 298, true], [454, 455, true], [654, 655, true], [816, 817, true], [953, 954, true], [1049, 1050, true], [1200, 1201, true], [1377, 1378, true], [1469, 1470, true]]}, {"id": 22931212, "text": "1. Here we report on the mechanism of ribose conjugation, through NADH as a cofactor, of a pyrazole-containing compound (PT). Incubation of PT in rat liver microsomes supplemented with NADP\u207a/H, NAD\u207a/H, and \u03b2-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) resulted in complete conjugation to the adenine dinucleotide phosphate conjugate (ADP-C), adenine dinucleotide conjugate (AD-C), and 5-phosphoribose conjugate (Rib-C1), respectively. In hepatocytes, PT predominantly formed three ribose conjugates: Rib-C1, the ribose conjugate (Rib-C2), and the carboxylic acid of Rib-C2 (Rib-C3). 2. Phosphatase inhibitors were added to hepatocyte incubations. AD-C was detected in this reaction, which suggests that one of the major pathways for the formation of the ribose conjugates is through NAD\u207a/H. When AD-C was incubated with phosphatase, Rib-C1 and Rib-C2 formed. 3. To understand the in vivo relevance of this metabolic pathway, rats were dosed with PT and Rib-C2 was found in the urine. 4. Structure-activity relationship shows that replacement of the distal thiazole group in the PT to a phenyl group abolishes this conjugation. Three amino acid residues in the active site preferentially interact with the sulfur atom in the thiazole of PT. 5. In summary, PT forms direct AD-C in hepatocytes, which is further hydrolyzed by phosphatase to give ribose conjugates.", "anno": [[124, 125, true], [423, 424, true], [571, 572, true], [635, 636, true], [779, 780, true], [847, 848, true], [972, 973, true], [1115, 1116, true], [1228, 1229, true], [1350, 1351, true]]}, {"id": 22935104, "text": "Drug repositioning, exemplified by sildenafil and thalidomide, is a promising way to explore alternative indications for existing drugs.

However, the mechanism of cytotoxicity used by autoreactive CD8 T cells in the human setting remains unknown. Using type 1 diabetes patient-derived preproinsulin-specific CD8 T-cell clones recognizing either an HLA-A2 (A*0201) or HLA-A24 (A*2402)-restricted epitope (peptide of preproinsulin [PPI](15-24), ALWGPDPAAA; or PPI(3-11), LWMRLLPLL), we assessed the use of conventional mediators of cytotoxicity in the destruction of human \u03b2-cells in vitro compared with virus-specific cytotoxic CD8 T-cell clones. We show that PPI-specific CD8 T-cell clones are mainly reliant upon cytotoxic degranulation for inducing \u03b2-cell death. Furthermore, we find that in comparison with virus-specific CD8 T cells, there are differences in the killing potency of PPI-specific CD8 T cells that are not due to cell-intrinsic differences, but rather are mediated by differences in strength of signaling by peptide-HLA ligands. The study highlights the regulation of \u03b2-cell killing as a potential point for therapeutic control, including the possibility of blocking autoreactive CD8 T-cell function without impacting upon general immune competence.", "anno": [[158, 159, true], [268, 269, true], [667, 668, true], [786, 787, true], [1068, 1069, true], [1289, 1290, true]]}, {"id": 22939943, "text": "Multiple lines of evidence support the idea that osteocytes act as mechanosensors in bone and that they control bone formation, in part, by expressing the Wnt antagonist sclerostin.

Using the cold neutron backscattering spectrometer IN16 at the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL, Grenoble, France), temperature dependence of cholinesterases' dynamics (human butyrylcholinesterase from plasma: hBChE; recombinant human acetylcholinesterase: hAChE and recombinant mouse acetylcholinesterase: mAChE) was examined using elastic incoherent neutron scattering (EINS). The dynamics was characterized by the averaged atomic mean square displacement (MSD), associated with the sample flexibility at a given temperature. We found MSD values of hAChE above the dynamical transition temperature (around 200K) larger than for mAChE and hBChE, implying that hAChE is more flexible than the other ChEs. Activation energies for thermodynamical transition were extracted through the frequency window model (FWM) (Becker et al. 2004) [1] and turned out to increase from hBChE to mAChE and finally to hAChE, inversely to the MSDs relations. Between 280 and 316K, catalytic studies of these enzymes were carried out using thiocholine esters: at the same temperature, the hAChE activity was systematically higher than the mAChE or hBChE ones. Our results thus suggest a strong correlation between dynamics and activity within the ChE family. We also studied and compared the ChEs thermal inactivation kinetics. Here, no direct correlation with the dynamics was observed, thus suggesting that relations between enzyme dynamics and catalytic stability are more complex.
