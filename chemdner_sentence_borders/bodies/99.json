The aim of this study was to elucidate the independent effect of uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC), an active form of osteocalcin which has been suggested to have an insulin sensitizing effect, on vascular endothelial cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used human aortic endothelial cells and treated them with ucOC. Linoleic acid (LA) was used as a representative free fatty acid. Apoptosis was evaluated using various methods including a terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling analysis kit and Western blotting for cleaved caspase 3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and Bcl-xL. The phosphorylations of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) as well as the level of NO were measured to confirm the effect of ucOC on insulin signaling pathway. RESULTS: Pretreatment of ucOC (30ng/ml) prevented LA-induced apoptosis in insulin-stimulated endothelial cells; effects were abolished by pretreatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor, wortmannin. Treatment of ucOC (ranged from 0.3 to 30ng/ml) significantly increased the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS and nitric oxide secretion from endothelial cells in a PI3-kinase dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to demonstrate the independent effect of ucOC on vascular endothelial cells. Our results further suggest that ucOC could have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis.", "anno": [[9, 10, true], [173, 174, true], [398, 399, true], [421, 422, true], [488, 489, true], [553, 554, true], [811, 812, true], [985, 986, true], [994, 995, true], [1211, 1212, true], [1402, 1403, true], [1415, 1416, true], [1515, 1516, true], [1603, 1604, true]]}, {"id": 23265535, "text": "The effects of vanadyl sulphate on the formation of acrylamide have been studied in fried potato products, such as French fries and chips.

These drugs usually have a low and variable oral bioavailability, and therefore an unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. One of the most promising approaches to increase dissolution rate and solubility of these drugs is the conversion of a crystalline form of the drug into its respective amorphous form, usually by incorporation into hydrophilic polymers, forming glass solutions. However, this strategy only led to a small number of marketed products usually because of inadequate physical stability of the drug (crystallization). In this study, we investigated a fundamentally different approach to stabilize the amorphous form of drugs, namely the use of amino acids as small molecular weight excipients that form specific molecular interactions with the drug resulting in co-amorphous forms. The two poorly water soluble drugs carbamazepine and indomethacin were combined with amino acids from the binding sites of the biological receptors of these drugs. Mixtures of drug and the amino acids arginine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine were prepared by vibrational ball milling. Solid-state characterization with X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that the various blends could be prepared as homogeneous, single phase co-amorphous formulations indicated by the appearance of an amorphous halo in the XRPD diffractograms and a single glass transition temperature (Tg) in the DSC measurements. In addition, the Tgs of the co-amorphous mixtures were significantly increased over those of the individual drugs. The drugs remained chemically stable during the milling process and the co-amorphous formulations were generally physically stable over at least 6months at 40\u00b0C under dry conditions.

Using a recombinant phospholipase-D from the venom gland of L. intermedia (LiRecDT1) in phospholipid-degrading kinetic experiments, we determined that this phospholipase-D mainly hydrolyzes synthetic sphingomyelin in a time-dependent manner, generating ceramide 1-phosphate plus choline, as well as lysophosphatidylcholine, generating lysophosphatidic acid plus choline, but exhibits little activity against phosphatidylcholine.

It proposes validation of identity, selectivity, precision, working range, limit of detection and robustness, bearing in mind that each \"result\" must include information about the chemical identity, particle size and mass or particle number concentration. This has an impact on testing for selectivity and trueness, which also must take these aspects into consideration.

CIT can co-occur with ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin also known for its nephrotoxicity, and this raises concern regarding possible combined effects. But, in contrast to OTA, data on CIT contamination in foods for human consumption are scarce, and CIT biomonitoring has not been conducted so far due a lack of suitable methods for human specimen. Thus, it was the aim of the present study to develop sensitive methods for the analysis of CIT in human blood and urine to investigate human exposure. To this end, we assessed different methods of sample preparation and instrumental analysis for these matrices. Clean-up of blood plasma by protein precipitation followed by LC-MS/MS-based analysis allowed robust detection of CIT (LOD 0.07\u00a0ng/mL, LOQ 0.15\u00a0ng/mL). For urine, sample clean-up by an immunoaffinity column (CitriTest(\u00ae)) proved to be clearly superior to SPE with RP(18) material for subsequent analysis by LC-MS/MS. For CIT and its metabolite dihydrocitrinone (HO-CIT), the LOD and LOQ determined by external calibration curves in matrix were 0.02 and 0.05\u00a0ng/mL for CIT, and those for HO-CIT were 0.05 and 0.1\u00a0ng/mL urine. The newly developed method was applied in a small pilot study: CIT was present in all plasma samples from 8 German adults, at concentrations ranging from 0.11 to 0.26\u00a0ng/mL. The molar (nM) concentrations of CIT are similar to those measured for OTA in these samples as a result of dietary mycotoxin intake.

In the present study, we have analysed the mechanism mediating this inhibition. TCDD treatment of the cells largely prevented the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, a regulator of translation initiation and substrate of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). By \"working upwards\" from mTOR, we observed that TCDD inhibited endogenous and IGF-I-induced AKT and ERK activation by interfering with tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1. This inhibition was mediated by a TCDD-induced secreted factor which was identified as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP-4). The induction of IGFBP-4 protein was dependent on a functional aryl hydrocarbon receptor and was preceded by a rapid increase in the level of IGFBP-4 mRNA indicating that IGFBP-4 is a previously unknown transcriptional target of TCDD in 5L cells. IGFBP-4 was not induced by TCDD in the parental cell line of 5L cells, Fao, and in various closely related rat hepatoma cell lines as well as in other unrelated cell types. Analysis of 5L cell chromosomes by multicolour spectral karyotyping (SKY) revealed that the cells carry several hitherto uncharacterised chromosomal translocations.

Reducing the endogenous level of EphA4 in individual neurons by RNAi effectively blocked activity-induced scaling-down of excitatory synaptic strength, while co-transfection of RNAi resistant EphA4 rescued this effect. Furthermore, interfering with EphA4 forward signaling using EphA4-Fc blocked activity-induced homeostatic synaptic scaling-down, while direct activation of EphA4 with its ligand EphrinA1 weakened excitatory synaptic strength. Up- or down-regulating EphA4 function in individual neurons also did not affect the density of excitatory synapses.

Although considerable efforts to delineate the underlying pathophysiological pathways have been made during the last decades, only very limited progress on treatment have been achieved because molecular pathways that drive the aggressive nature of GBM are largely unknown. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of environmental factors and the role of gene-environment interactions (GEI) in the development of GBM. Factors such as small sample sizes and study costs have limited the conduct of GEI studies in brain tumors however. Additionally, advances in high-throughput microarrays have produced a wealth of information concerning molecular biology of glioma. In particular, microarrays have been used to obtain genetic and epigenetic changes between normal non-tumor tissue and glioma tissue. Due to the relative rarity of gliomas, microarray data for these tumors is often the product of small studies, and thus pooling this data becomes desirable. To address the challenge of small sample sizes and GEI study difficulties, we introduce a comprehensive bioinformatics method using genetic variations (copy number variations and small-scale variations) and environmental data integration that links with Glioblastoma (GEG) to identify: (1) genes that interact with chemicals and have genetic variants linked to the development of GBM, (2) important pathways that may be influenced by environmental exposures (or endogenous chemicals), and (3) genes with variants in GBM that have been understudied in relation to GBM development. The first step in our GEG method identified genes responsive to environmental exposures using the Environmental Genome Project, Comparative Toxicology, and Seattle SNPs databases. These environmentally responsive genes were then compared to a curated list of genes containing copy number variation and/or mutations in GBM. This comparison produced a list of genes responsive to the environment and important to GBM that was then further analyzed using gene networking tools such as RSpider, Cytoscape, and DAVID. Using this GEG bioinformatics method we were able to identify 173 genes with the potential to be involved in GEI that may be important to the development of GBM. Sixty five of these environmentally responsive genes have not been reported as important to GBM development, despite several of them having substantial potential for response to chemicals and subsequent disease related actions. The main biological functions of these 173 genes include signaling by Nerve Growth Factor, DNA Repair, Integrin Cell Surface Interactions, Biological Oxidations, Apoptosis, Synaptic Transmission, Cell Cycle Checkpoints, and Arachidonic Acid Metabolism.

When proteostasis is imbalanced, NAC relocalizes from a ribosome-associated state to protein aggregates in its role as a chaperone. This results in a functional depletion of NAC from the ribosome that diminishes translational capacity and the flux of nascent proteins. Depletion of NAC from polysomes and re-localisation to protein aggregates is observed during ageing, in response to heat shock and upon expression of the highly aggregation-prone polyglutamine-expansion proteins and A\u03b2-peptide.

An improved potency was found for second type derived from sulfonylated 3-amindinophenylalanylamide derivates. The most potent derivative of this series inhibits TMPRSS2 with a Ki value of 0.9 nM and showed an efficient blockage of influenza virus propagation in human airway epithelial cells. Based on the inhibitor studies a series of new fluorogenic substrates containing a d-arginine residue in P3 position was synthesized, some of them were efficiently cleaved by TMPRSS2.", "anno": [[227, 228, true], [352, 353, true], [427, 428, true], [493, 494, true], [664, 665, true], [747, 748, true], [936, 937, true], [1047, 1048, true], [1230, 1231, true], [1414, 1415, true]]}, {"id": 23017391, "text": "The LC-MS/MS technique was applied to the stability study of several flavonoids and phenolic acids in honey samples during the ultrasonic extraction (USE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). Phenolic compounds from the standard mixture were stable under ultrasounds action with the mean recovery of (90.4%\u00b17.1%), but during microwave-assisted extraction the benzoic acid derivatives and aglycones of flavonoids showed lower recovery (70-80%). In honey matrix, the phenolic acids and the glycosides exhibited the high stability for MAE and USE treatments. However, the recoveries of tested aglycones were below 10%. In the presence of an artificial sugar matrix, flavonols were almost completely degraded after successive treatment under MAE and USE conditions. The obtained results indicated that standard addition method for flavonoids quantification in honey samples should not be recommended. Application of the USE conditions provided higher and/or similar extraction yields for phenolic acids than usually applied shaking with solvent. It also allowed shortening the time required for the whole sample preparation procedure. Phenolic acids and glycosides such as quercetrin, rutin and hesperidin appeared to be stable under such conditions.", "anno": [[194, 195, true], [446, 447, true], [558, 559, true], [618, 619, true], [764, 765, true], [899, 900, true], [1044, 1045, true], [1133, 1134, true], [1249, 1250, true]]}, {"id": 23295222, "text": "Aldh1l1, also known as 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH), contains the carboxy-terminal domain (Ct-FDH), which is a structural and functional homolog of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). This domain is capable of catalyzing the NADP(+)-dependent oxidation of short chain aldehydes to their corresponding acids, and similar to most ALDHs it has two conserved catalytic residues, Cys707 and Glu673. Previously, we demonstrated that in the Ct-FDH mechanism these residues define the conformation of the bound coenzyme and the affinity of its interaction with the protein. Specifically, the replacement of Cys707 with an alanine resulted in the enzyme lacking the ability to differentiate between the oxidized and reduced coenzyme. We suggested that this was due to the loss of a covalent bond between the cysteine and the C4N atom of nicotinamide ring of NADP(+) formed during Ct-FDH catalysis. To obtain further insight into the functional significance of the covalent bond between Cys707 and the coenzyme, and the overall role of the two catalytic residues in the coenzyme binding and positioning, we have now solved crystal structures of Ct-FDH in the complex with thio-NADP(+) and the complexes of the C707S mutant with NADP(+) and NADPH. This study has allowed us to trap the coenzyme in the contracted conformation, which provided a snapshot of the conformational processing of the coenzyme during the transition from oxidized to reduced form. Overall, the results of this study further support the previously proposed mechanism by which Cys707 helps to differentiate between the oxidized and reduced coenzyme during ALDH catalysis.", "anno": [[196, 197, true], [406, 407, true], [578, 579, true], [737, 738, true], [901, 902, true], [1249, 1250, true], [1456, 1457, true], [1645, 1646, true]]}]}
