We previously demonstrated that the somatostatinergic system, implicated in neuronal survival control, can be modulated by \u03b1-tocopherol in the rat dentate gyrus, increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein phosphorylation. To gain a better understanding of the molecular actions of tocopherols and examine the link among vitamin E, somatostatin and neuronal survival, we have investigated the effects of a deficiency and subsequent administration of tocopherol on the somatostatin signaling pathway and neuronal survival in the rat hippocampus. No changes in somatostatin expression were detected in vitamin-E-deficient rats. These rats, however, showed a significant increase in the somatostatin receptor density and dissociation constant, which correlated with a significant increase in the protein levels of somatostatin receptors. Nevertheless, vitamin E deficiency impaired the ability of the somatostatin receptors to couple to the effectors adenylyl cyclase and phosphotyrosine phosphatase by diminishing Gi protein functionality. Furthermore, vitamin E deficiency significantly increased phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and PTP\u03b7 expression, as well as PKC\u03b4 activation, and decreased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. All these changes were accompanied by an increase in neuronal cell death. Subsequent \u03b1-tocopherol administration partially or completely reversed all these values to control levels. Altogether, our results prove the importance of vitamin E homeostasis in the somatostatin receptor-effector system and suggest a possible mechanism by which this vitamin may regulate the neuronal cell survival in the adult hippocampus.", "anno": [[200, 201, true], [454, 455, true], [776, 777, true], [857, 858, true], [1066, 1067, true], [1269, 1270, true], [1482, 1483, true], [1556, 1557, true], [1664, 1665, true], [1900, 1901, true]]}, {"id": 23619607, "text": "Liver injure is induced by various insults such as alcohol abuse, if insults persistent, may result in the formation of liver fibrosis.

Amongst the different procedures evaluated, the use of a SDS 0.1% PBS solution to remove the sticky and greasy test material prior to the normal washing procedures was found to be the most suitable adaptation to ensure efficient removal of greasy and sticky in-house controls without affecting the results of the negative control. The predictive capacity of the refined SDS 0.1% washing procedure, was investigated by using twelve oily and viscous compounds having known skin irritation effects supported by raw and/or peer reviewed in vivo data. The normal washing procedure resulted in 8 out of 10 correctly predicted compounds as compared to 9 out of 10 with the refined washing procedures, showing an increase in the predictive ability of the assay. The refined washing procedure allowed to correctly identify all in vivo skin irritant materials showing the same sensitivity as the normal washing procedures, and further increased the specificity of the assay from 5 to 6 correct predictions out of 7 non irritants as compared to the normal washing procedures. In addition, when exposed to non-irritant oily and viscous materials, tissues rinsed with 0.1% SDS generally showed increased viabilities accompanied by decreased variabilities as compared to the normal washing procedures. Similar results were obtained when testing typical in-house natural botanical ingredients. In conclusion, the use of a refined washing procedure making use of SDS 0.1% in PBS was found a suitable procedure to ensure efficient removal of greasy and sticky materials, leading to an increased predictive capacity and decreased variability of the tissue responses while maintaining its sensitivity and not affecting untreated tissues morphology and viability.", "anno": [[194, 195, true], [440, 441, true], [792, 793, true], [1014, 1015, true], [1345, 1346, true], [1561, 1562, true], [1768, 1769, true], [2079, 2080, true], [2302, 2303, true], [2393, 2394, true], [2758, 2759, true]]}, {"id": 23642037, "text": "Periodic Aharonov-Bohm and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations have traditionally been observed in lateral transport through patterned mesoscopic loops of diffusive conductors.

First, a porous Si sample is prepared by electrochemical etch and then it is mildly oxidized, which places a thin layer of silicon oxide at the surface. The inner pore walls of the partially oxidized porous Si film are then infiltrated with an inert liquid (octane). The sample is then immersed in aqueous solution containing hydrogen fluoride (HF), which serves as the reactive liquid. The hydrophobic phase is retained in the interior of the porous nanostructure, and HF(aq) attacks only the exposed surfaces of the oxidized porous Si sample, generating a hydrophobic, hydrogen-terminated (Si-H) outer layer. The reaction is self-limiting due to the immiscibility of octane and water, and the extent of penetration of the Si-H surface into the porous layer is dependent on the time of exposure to HF(aq). The Si-H surface can then be modified by thermal hydrosilylation (1-dodecene or 10-bromo-1-decene) in a subsequent step, resulting in a bifunctional porous Si film containing hydrophobic pore entrances to hydrophilic inner pores.

The mean concentration of Se in fruits differs significantly from that found in flowers and roots. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the Se content in herbs and leaves and its levels in fruits, flowers, and roots.

Several strains of infant gut-associated bifidobacteria possess lacto-N-biosidase, a membrane-anchored extracellular enzyme, that liberates LNB from the nonreducing end of human milk oligosaccharides and plays a key role in the metabolic pathway of these compounds.

This review focuses on the multiple roles of VEGF in the adult brain and is less concerned with the roles played by VEGF during brain development, functions described elsewhere in this review series. Most functions of VEGF that are essential for proper brain development are, in fact, dispensable in the adult brain as was clearly demonstrated using a conditional brain-specific VEGF loss-of-function (LOF) approach. Thus, in contrast to VEGF LOF in the developing brain, a process which is detrimental for the growth and survival of blood vessels and leads to massive neuronal apoptosis [2-4], continued signaling by VEGF in the mature brain is no longer required for maintaining already established cerebral vasculature and its inhibition does not cause appreciable vessel regression, hypoxia or apoptosis [4-7].

Increased activity of cortical 5-HT(2A) receptors has been associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia. Here we examine the mechanisms involved in this enhanced ERK1/2 activation in rat PFCx and in a neuronal cell model. Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a non-selective cannabinoid agonist (CP55940, 50\u03bcg/kg, 7 days, i.p.) showed enhanced co-immunoprecipitation of \u03b2-Arrestin 2 and ERK1/2, enhanced pERK protein levels, and enhanced expression of \u03b2-Arrestin 2 mRNA and protein levels in PFCx. In a neuronal cell line, we found that selective CB(2) receptor agonists upregulate \u03b2-Arrestin 2, an effect that was prevented by selective CB(2) receptor antagonist JTE-907 and CB(2) shRNA lentiviral particles. Additionally, inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, ERK1/2, and the AP-1 transcription factor also prevented the cannabinoid receptor-induced upregulation of \u03b2-Arrestin 2. Our results suggest that sustained activation of CB(2) receptors would enhance \u03b2-Arrestin 2 expression possibly contributing to its increased interaction with ERK1/2, thereby driving the upregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors. The CB(2) receptor-mediated upregulation of \u03b2-Arrestin 2 would be mediated, at least in part, by an ERK1/2-dependent activation of AP-1.

We studied tumor characteristics, risk of biochemical recurrence and mortality after radical prostatectomy in 5-ARI and alpha-blocker users. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 1,315 men who underwent radical prostatectomy at the Tampere University Hospital during 1995-2009. Biochemical relapse was defined as serum PSA\u2009\u2265\u20090.2\u2009ng/ml after the operation. Information on mortality and medication purchases was obtained from national registries. Cox proportional regression was used to analyze hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of biochemical relapse and death. RESULTS: The proportion of high-grade (Gleason 7-10) tumors was significantly elevated among men who had used 5-ARIs for 4 years or longer compared to the non-users (83.3% vs. 53.3%, respectively). Survival curves for biochemical relapse-free survival differed between long-term and short-term 5-ARI users, but the hazard ratio remained statistically non-significant. Risk of biochemical recurrence was elevated among alpha-blocker users (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.37-2.06), but in sensitivity analyses this was evident only in men using alpha-blockers after prostatectomy. Mortality was not associated with medication usage. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term users of finasteride or dutasteride had more often high-grade prostate cancer. Our results suggest also worse progression-free survival. The association between risk of biochemical recurrence and post-operative alpha-blocker usage suggests that voiding or storage symptoms after prostatectomy may predict biochemical relapse.

Under the assay conditions, diasesartemin (IC(50) = 60.6 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5M) was found to be more potent than the positive control, acarbose (IC(50) = 92.94 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5M); a known \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor (p < 0.05). The IC(50) values of epi-mukulin and (Z)-guggulsterone were found to be 159.33 and 132.14 \u00b5M, respectively. Other compounds showed weak \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effects, <30% inhibition of the enzyme activity at 0.1 mg mL(-1).", "anno": [[377, 378, true], [456, 457, true], [556, 557, true], [659, 660, true], [863, 864, true], [971, 972, true], [1090, 1091, true]]}, {"id": 23161561, "text": "Because associations between agents and environmental effects are not necessarily causal, it is necessary to assess causation before using such relationships in environmental management. The authors adapted epidemiological methods to assess general causal hypotheses. General causation establishes that an agent is capable of causing an effect. The method uses all relevant and good-quality evidence in a weight-of-evidence system. The system is credible due to its explicit a priori criteria. The evidence is organized in terms of six characteristics of causation: co-occurrence, preceding causation, interaction, alteration, sufficiency, and time order. The causal assessment proceeds through six steps that generate, organize, and score evidence to determine whether causation is adequately supported by the body of evidence.", "anno": [[185, 186, true], [266, 267, true], [343, 344, true], [430, 431, true], [492, 493, true], [654, 655, true], [827, 828, true]]}, {"id": 23621521, "text": "Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells form a monolayer adjacent to the retina and play a critical role in the visual light cycle. Degeneration of this layer results in vision loss, causing retinal disorders such as age-related macular degeneration. Cell transplant therapies exist to restore vision loss; however, risks associated with and an inadequate supply of donor cells have limited their therapeutic success. The identification of factors that proliferate RPE cells ex vivo could provide a renewable source of cells for the treatment of such disorders. We show that a small molecule (WS3) can reversibly proliferate primary RPE cells isolated from fetal and adult human donors. Following withdrawal of WS3, RPE cells differentiate into a functional monolayer, as exhibited by their expression of mature RPE genes and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Furthermore, chemically expanded RPE cells preserve vision when transplanted into dystrophic Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats, a well-established model of retinal degeneration.", "anno": [[129, 130, true], [248, 249, true], [415, 416, true], [559, 560, true], [684, 685, true], [869, 870, true], [1050, 1051, true]]}]}
