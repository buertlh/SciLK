We use bioinformatics to identify the L1 stalk RNA conservation patterns and carry out over 11.5 \u03bcs of MD simulations for a set of systems ranging from isolated RNA building blocks up to complexes of L1 stalk rRNA with the L1 protein and tRNA fragment. We show that the L1 stalk tetraloop has an unusual GNNA or UNNG conservation pattern deviating from major GNRA and YNMG RNA tetraloop families. We suggest that this deviation is related to a highly conserved tertiary contact within the L1 stalk. The available X-ray structures contain only UCCG tetraloops which in addition differ in orientation (anti vs syn) of the guanine. Our analysis suggests that the anti orientation might be a mis-refinement, although even the anti interaction would be compatible with the sequence pattern and observed tertiary interaction. Alternatively, the anti conformation may be a real substate whose population could be pH-dependent, since the guanine syn orientation requires protonation of cytosine in the tertiary contact. In absence of structural data, we use molecular modeling to explore the GCCA tetraloop that is dominant in bacteria and suggest that the GCCA tetraloop is structurally similar to the YNMG tetraloop.

Ischemia was produced in rats by ligature of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30min. At the end of the 2-h reperfusion, western blot analysis of the cardioprotective transcription factors pJAK2, pERK1/2, pTyr-STAT3 and pSer-STAT3, the inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), the pro-apoptotic factors BAX and c-jun N-terminal kinases (pJNK), the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL, as well as of the cardioprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), was performed in the left ventricle and spleen. Intravenous treatment, during coronary artery occlusion, with the melanocortin analogs [Nle(4), D-Phe(7)]\u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NDP-\u03b1-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone 1-24 [ACTH-(1-24)], induced a left ventricle up-regulation of pJAK2, pERK1/2 and pTyr-STAT3 (JAK-dependent), and a reduction in pJNK and TNF-\u03b1 levels; these effects of NDP-\u03b1-MSH and ACTH-(1-24) were associated with over-expression of the pro-survival proteins HO-1 and Bcl-XL, and marked decrease of the myocardial infarct size. Melanocortin treatment did not affect left ventricle pSer-STAT3 (ERK1/2-dependent) and BAX levels. In the spleen, NDP-\u03b1-MSH and ACTH-(1-24) induced similar effects on the expression of the above transcription factors/proteins, except for pERK1/2 (down-regulated) and HO-1 (unaffected). Blockade of JAK and ERK pathways with AG490 and U0126, respectively, abrogated the myocardial infarct size reduction by NDP-\u03b1-MSH. These results indicate that melanocortins inhibit local and systemic inflammatory and apoptotic cascades triggered by prolonged myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, with consequent reduction in myocardium infarct size, seemingly via activation of the JAK/STAT signaling and with modulation of an ERK (STAT unrelated) signaling pathway.", "anno": [[188, 189, true], [309, 310, true], [479, 480, true], [580, 581, true], [1002, 1003, true], [1513, 1514, true], [1612, 1613, true], [1799, 1800, true], [1930, 1931, true], [2262, 2263, true]]}, {"id": 23535821, "text": "Children with autism have an elevated frequency of large, rare copy number variants (CNVs).

The aim of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of curcumin and antibiotics as well as to determine the antibacterial activity of CCM against specific MRSA strains. The antibacterial activity of CCM was assessed by the broth microdilution method (by calculating the minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC]), checkerboard dilution test, and time-kill assay. Antimicrobial activity of CCM was observed against all tested strains. The MICs of CCM against 10 strains of S. aureus ranged from 125 to 250\u03bcg/ml. In the checkerboard test, CCM markedly reduced the MICs of the antibiotics oxacillin (OXI), ampicillin (AMP), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and norfloxacin (NOR) used against MRSA. The time-kill curves showed that a combined CCM and OXI treatment reduced the bacterial counts below the lowest detectable limit after 24h.

The purpose of this article is to review our current understanding of leptin and its functional role on the different resident cell types of the lung in health as well as in the context of three major respiratory conditions being chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and pneumonia.", "anno": [[205, 206, true], [362, 363, true], [673, 674, true], [972, 973, true]]}, {"id": 23543014, "text": "Gebel (2012) performed a quantitative review of inhalation rat studies on the association of granular biopersistent dust exposures and lung cancer risk.

The target SAMDC gene fragments of three homologues were cloned in a hairpin RNA construct under the control of tapetal-specific A9 promoter, which was used to generate several RNAi tomato plants. These RNAi lines expressed the intended small interfering RNAs in the anther and showed the aborted and sterile pollen exhibiting shrunken and distorted morphology. These RNAi tomato plants having sterile pollen, failed to set fruits but female fertility of the plants remained unaffected as cross pollination resulted in fruit setting. Expression profiling of SAMDC genes showed considerable decrease in transcripts of SAMDC1 (5-8 fold) and SAMDC2 and SAMDC3 (2-3 fold) in the anthers of RNAi plants. The other polyamine biosynthesis genes, ADC and SPDSYN exhibited ~1.5 fold decrease in their transcript levels. Presence of siRNA molecules specific to SAMDC homologues in anther and tapetal-specific activity of A9 promoter as shown with GUS reporter system of RNAi plants suggested down-regulation of the target genes in tapetum by RNAi.

This is an unexpected property of hCTR1, a highly selective copper (I) transporter. We compared the uptake rates of copper with cDDP (and several analogs) into HEK293 cells over-expressing wild-type or mutant hCTR1, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) that do or do not express CTR1, and human ovarian tumor cells, sensitive or resistant to cDDP. We have also compared the effects of extracellular copper, which causes regulatory endocytosis of hCTR1, to those of cDDP. We confirm the correlation between higher hCTR1 levels and higher Pt-drug uptake in tumor cells sensitive to the drug. However, we show that hCTR1 is not the major entry route of platinum-drugs and that the copper transporter is not internalized in response to extracellular drug. Our data suggest the major entry pathway for platinum-drugs is not saturable at relevant concentrations and not protein-mediated.

METHODS: SAE were evaluated for antimutagenic property in Salmonella strains (TA97a, TA98, TA100, and TA102), in the presence and absence of metabolic activation (S9). The SAE was also studied for antigenotoxic property against cyclophosphamide (CP) in Swiss albino male mice in vivo. The extract was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The study reveals antimutagenic property of the bark extract in Salmonella strains in the presence and absence of metabolic activation (S9). The study reports antigenotoxic property of the bark extract against CP in vivo. Thiobarbituric acid reactive species assay on the bark extract revealed antioxidant property. HPLC revealed the presence of two peaks corresponding to gallic acid and (-)-epicatechin, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study clearly reveals the antimutagenic and antigenotoxic properties of SAE. </abstract>", "anno": [[9, 10, true], [26, 27, true], [157, 158, true], [231, 232, true], [338, 339, true], [347, 348, true], [506, 507, true], [623, 624, true], [701, 702, true], [710, 711, true], [851, 852, true], [932, 933, true], [1026, 1027, true], [1130, 1131, true], [1142, 1143, true], [1223, 1224, true], [1235, 1236, true]]}, {"id": 23546525, "text": "Azidoacetylene is a highly explosive substance, which has been synthesized and characterized for the first time quite recently [Banert et al., Angew.

For that reason, we have studied the vibrational spectrum of the title compound by gas phase measurements and high-level vibrational structure calculations beyond the harmonic approximation. Based on the interplay of theory and experiment, we were able to identify all fundamentals, strong Fermi resonances and intense overtones, which contribute to the spectrum.", "anno": [[182, 183, true], [285, 286, true], [476, 477, true], [649, 650, true]]}, {"id": 23546600, "text": "Gonadotropin Regulated Testicular RNA Helicase (GRTH/Ddx25) is a post-transcriptional regulator of genes that are essential for spermatid elongation and completion of spermatogenesis. It also prevents Leydig cells (LC) from gonadotropin overstimulation of androgen production. In transgenic (Tg) mice carrying deletions of the GRTH 5' flanking regions we previously demonstrated that the -1085 bp to ATG contains the elements for basal and androgen-induced LC specific expression. No expression in germ cells (GC) was found with sequences extended up to -3.6 Kb. To define regulatory regions of GRTH required for expression in GC, Tg mice were generated with 5' flanking sequence 6.4 Kb (6.4 Kb-Tg) and/or deletion using GFP as reporter gene in the present study. GFP was expressed in all lines. Immuno-histochemistry analysis showed that 6.4Kb-Tg directed GFP expression in both GC and LC. Deletion of the sequence -205 bp to -3.6 Kb (6.4Kb/del-Tg) directs GFP expression only in meiotic and haploid GCs. This indicated that the distal region -6.4 Kb/-3.6 Kb is required for GRTH cell specific expression in GC. Also, it inhibits the expression of GRTH in LC directed by the 205 bp promoter, an effect that is neutralized by the -3.6Kb/-205bp sequence. Flutamide treatment prevents GFP/GRTH expression in Tg lines demonstrating in vivo direct and indirect effects of endogenous androgen on GC and LC, respectively. Our studies have generated and characterized transgenic lines that can be utilized to define requirements for cell specific expression of the GRTH gene and to further advance our knowledge on the regulation of GRTH by androgen in germ cells.", "anno": [[182, 183, true], [275, 276, true], [479, 480, true], [561, 562, true], [762, 763, true], [794, 795, true], [889, 890, true], [1004, 1005, true], [1111, 1112, true], [1252, 1253, true], [1414, 1415, true], [1656, 1657, true]]}]}
