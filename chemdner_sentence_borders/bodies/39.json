Because estradiol concentrations increase by \u223c50-fold during human pregnancy, it was hypothesized that the increasing estradiol concentrations during human pregnancy would result in induction of CYP2B6 activity. Hepatocytes from three female donors were treated with estradiol, and the EC(50) and E(max) were measured for CYP2B6 mRNA and bupropion hydroxylation activity. The measured values were used to predict the magnitude of CYP2B6 induction during human pregnancy. At 100 nM total estradiol, a concentration achievable during the third trimester of pregnancy, CYP2B6 activity was predicted to increase by 1.5-3-fold, based on increased CYP2B6 activity and mRNA. When the E(max) and EC(50) values were compared with those for carbamazepine and rifampin, estradiol was found to be as potent an inducer of CYP2B6 as rifampin and carbamazepine.

Between matched pairs of statin users and nonusers, the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were as follows: Psych1 (0.9, 0.75-1.05), Psych2 (1.02, 0.94-1.11), and Psych3 (1.02, 0.96-1.1), respectively.

The most potent analogue, Pyrimidyn 7, has an IC50 of 1.1 \u03bcM for dynamin I and 1.8 \u03bcM for dynamin II, making it among the most potent dynamin inhibitors identified to date. We investigated the mechanism of action of the Pyrimidyn compounds in detail by examining the kinetics of Pyrimidyn 7 inhibition of dynamin. The compound competitively inhibits both GTP and phospholipid interactions with dynamin I. While both mechanisms of action have been previously observed separately, this is the first inhibitor series to incorporate both and thereby targets two distinct domains of dynamin. Pyrimidyn 6 and 7 reversibly inhibit CME of both transferrin and EGF in a number of non-neuronal cell lines as well as inhibiting synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) in nerve terminals.

METHODS: A two-stage, open-label study was conducted in neonates and infants less than 2\u00a0months of age in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A total of 207 piperacillin and 204 tazobactam concentration-time data sets from 71 patients were analyzed using a nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach (NONMEM VII). PK models were developed for piperacillin and tazobactam. The final models were evaluated using both bootstrap and visual predictive checks. External model evaluations were made in 20 additional patients. RESULTS: For neonates and young infants less than 2\u00a0months of age, the median central clearance was 0.133\u00a0and 0.149 L/h/kg for piperacillin and tazobactam, respectively. Postmenstrual age (PMA) was identified as the most significant covariate on central clearance of piperacillin and tazobactam. However, the combination of current bodyweight (BW) and postnatal age proved to be superior to PMA alone. BW was the most important covariate for apparent central volume of distribution. Both internal and external evaluations supported the prediction of the final piperacillin and tazobactam PK models. The dosing strategy 44.44/5.56\u00a0mg/kg/dose piperacillin/tazobactam every 8 or 12\u00a0h evaluated in this study achieved the pharmacodynamic target (free piperacillin concentrations >4\u00a0mg/L for more than 50\u00a0% of the dosing interval) in about 67\u00a0% of infants.

The purpose of this work was to explore the possibility to use the NCTC2544 assay to identify photoallergens and discriminate from phototoxic chemicals.

METHODS: We synthesized evidence on type 1 diabetes patients using several published sources. The simulation model was based on 13 equations to estimate risks of events and mortality. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was obtained from results of the DCCT (diabetes control and complications trial). Mortality post-CVD event was based on a study using linked administrative data on people with diabetes from Western Australia. Information on incidence of renal disease and the progression to CVD was obtained from studies in Finland and Italy. Lower-extremity amputation (LEA) risk was based on the type 1 diabetes Swedish inpatient registry, and the risk of blindness was obtained from results of a German-based study. Where diabetes-specific data were unavailable, information from other populations was used. We examine the degree and source of parameter uncertainty and illustrate an application of the model in estimating lifetime outcomes of using intensive and conventional treatments for blood glucose control. RESULTS: From 15\u00a0years of age, male and female patients had an estimated life expectancy of 47.2 (95\u00a0% CI 35.2-59.2) and 52.7 (95\u00a0% CI 41.7-63.6)\u00a0years in the intensive treatment group.

CONCLUSIONS: The model incorporates diabetic complications risk data from a type 1 diabetes population and synthesizes other type 1-specific data to estimate long-term outcomes of CVD, end-stage renal disease, LEA and risk of blindness, along with life expectancy and QALYs. External validation was carried out using life expectancy and absolute risk for fatal CVD events. Because of the flexible and transparent nature of the model, it has many potential future applications.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [290, 291, true], [299, 300, true], [384, 385, true], [474, 475, true], [590, 591, true], [717, 718, true], [834, 835, true], [1010, 1011, true], [1102, 1103, true], [1309, 1310, true], [1318, 1319, true], [1495, 1496, true], [1686, 1687, true], [1840, 1841, true], [1853, 1854, true], [2115, 2116, true], [2213, 2214, true], [2317, 2318, true]]}, {"id": 23644199, "text": "To elucidate the pharmacophore of echinocystic acid (EA), an oleanane-type triterpene displaying substantial inhibitory activity on HCV entry, two microbial strains, Rhizopus chinensis CICC 3043 and Alternaria alternata AS 3.4578, were utilized to modify the chemical structure of EA. Eight new metabolites with regio- and stereo-selective introduction of hydroxyl and lactone groups at various inert carbon positions were obtained. The anti-HCV entry activity of the metabolites 2-13, along with their parental compound EA and other analogs 14-15, were evaluated. Most of the metabolites showed no improvement but detrimental effect on potency except compound 5 and 6, which showed similar and even a litter higher anti-HCV entry activity than that of EA. The results demonstrated that ring A, B, C and the left side of ring E of EA are highly conserved, while ring D and the right side of ring E of EA are flexible. Introduction of a hydroxyl group at C-16 enhanced the triterpene potency. Further analysis indicated that the hemolytic effect of EA disappeared upon such modifications.", "anno": [[283, 284, true], [431, 432, true], [563, 564, true], [755, 756, true], [916, 917, true], [990, 991, true], [1086, 1087, true]]}]}
