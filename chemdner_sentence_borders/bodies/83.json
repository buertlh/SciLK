We demonstrate in this article efficient photon transfer in discrete optoplasmonic molecules comprising gold nanoparticle (NP) dimer antennas located in the evanescent field of a 2 \u03bcm diameter polystyrene bead, which served as an optical microcavity (OM). The optoplasmonic molecules were generated through a guided self-assembly strategy in which the OMs were immobilized in binding sites generated by quartz (SiO2) or silicon posts that contained plasmonic nanoantennas on their tips. Control of the post height facilitated an accurate positioning of the plasmonic antennas into the evanescent field of the whispering gallery modes located in the equatorial plane of the OM. Cy3 and Cy5.5 dyes were tethered to the plasmonic antennas through oligonucleotide spacers to act as on-chip light sources. The intensity of Cy3 was found to be increased relative to that of Cy5.5 in the vicinity of the plasmonic antennas where strongly enhanced electric field intensity and optical density of states selectively increase the excitation and emission rates of Cy3 due to spectral overlap with the plasmon. The fluorescent dyes preferentially emitted into the OM, which efficiently trapped and recirculated the photons.

Transient transfection of Gnrhr promoter luciferase fusion constructs together with either GATA2 expression vectors or small interfering RNA in gonadotrope cell lines indicated that GATA2, which typically acts as a trans-activator, unexpectedly repressed Gnrhr promoter activity. Using DNA chromatography affinity and EMSA, we demonstrated that GATA2 operates via a response element containing a peculiar palindromic GATA motif that overlaps a critical TAAT motif involved in LHX3/ISL1 trans-activation. Indeed, despite the inhibitory action of GATA2, this element displayed a clear-cut enhancer activity in gonadotrope cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that GATA2, LHX3, and ISL1 interact with a Gnrhr promoter fragment encompassing this element. The trans-repressive action of GATA2 on Gnrhr promoter activity is likely balanced or even hindered by trans-activating effects of LIM homeodomain proteins via this novel bifunctional LIM/GATA response element.

In particular, the hierarchical CMGNR microspheres consisting of the aggregates of CMG/Nafion (CMGN) nanosheets and RuO2 NPs provided large surface area and facile ion accessibility to storage sites, while the interconnected nanosheets offered continuous electron pathways and mechanical integrity. The synergistic effect of CMGNR hybrids on the supercapacitor (SC) performance was derived from the hybrid composition of pseudocapacitive RuO2 NPs with the conductive CMGNs as well as from structural features. Consequently, the CMGNR-SCs showed a specific capacitance as high as 160 F g(-1), three-fold higher than that of conventional graphene SCs, and a capacitance retention of >95% of the maximum value even after severe bending and 1000 charge-discharge tests due to the structural and compositional features.", "anno": [[150, 151, true], [358, 359, true], [572, 573, true], [871, 872, true], [1082, 1083, true], [1387, 1388, true]]}, {"id": 23369536, "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes major public health problems worldwide.

The present study investigates the pathways synergistically activated by cisplatin and TNF-\u03b1 responsible for TNF-\u03b1-enhanced cisplatin-induced renal cell injury. To do so, immortalized renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (IM-PTECs) were co-treated with TNF-\u03b1 and cisplatin.

The in vitro results confirmed that the delivery kinetics of BMP-2 and/or bFGF are more dependent on the degree of crosslinking than on the type of gelatin. Sequential release characterized by rapid release of angiogenic bFGF and more sustained release of BMP-2 was obtained by loading bFGF onto cationic nanospheres of low crosslinking density and BMP-2 onto anionic nanospheres of high crosslinking density.

How the physiological processes initiated during an acute stress response mediate sex- and nuclei- specific changes in AA and which stress response hormones are involved remains to be determined.

We used commercially available ELISA to analyse circulating levels of the markers. Pulse wave propagation time (PWP) was determined to assess arterial stiffness. RESULTS: The criteria for having MetS were filled by 221 subjects. sGP130, sIL-6r and IL-6 levels were elevated in subjects with MetS (p<0.05 for all markers), and are associated with increasing components of MetS.

We have utilised dissociated primary cortical neuronal cultures, which after 7 days in vitro have formed functional synaptic connections and display periodic and spontaneous synchronised calcium (Ca(2+)) oscillations in response to intrinsic action potential bursts. We herein demonstrate that in addition to non-selective group II mGlu receptor agonists, (2R,4R)-APDC, LY379268 and DCG-IV, a selective mGlu2 agonist, LY541850, and mGlu2 positive allosteric modulators, BINA and CBiPES, inhibit the frequency of synchronised Ca(2+) oscillations in primary cultures of rat and mouse cortical neurons. Use of cultures from wild-type, mGlu2(-/-), mGlu3(-/-) and mGlu2/3(-/-) mice allowed us to further probe the contribution of mGlu2 and mGlu3, and revealed LY541850 to be a partial mGlu2 agonist and a full mGlu3 antagonist. Overnight pre-treatment of cultures with these ligands revealed a preferred desensitisation profile after treatment with a positive allosteric modulator.

A combination of cell cycle analysis, immunocytometry, immunoblotting, and RNA interference revealed that SB induced a BubR1-dependent mitotic arrest. Mechanistically, SB was shown to possess a microtubule destabilizing activity evidenced by hyperphosphorylation of Bcl2 and BclxL, suppression of microtubule polymerization and induction of a prometaphase arrest. Molecular docking studies suggested that SB has a good affinity towards vinblastine-binding site on \u03b2-tubulin subunit. Of note, SB265610 which is a close structural analogue of SB225002 with a potent IL-8RB antagonistic activity did not exhibit a similar antimitotic activity.

However, no study has reviewed effects of nicotine on bone and fracture repair independent of other constituents of cigarette smoke. The authors review the existing evidence of the effect of nicotine on 'bone' and 'bone cells' and fracture repair, drawing conclusions relevant to clinical practice and future research. AREAS COVERED: A literature review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines and PubMed, Cochrane, MEDLINE/OVID, EMBASE, NHS Evidence and Google scholar databases. Articles were included if they specifically investigated the effects of nicotine on 'bone' or fracture repair in animal or human models or in vitro effects on 'bone cells'. A total of 64 papers were included in this review, of which 15 were human in vitro studies and 49 animal studies wherein 9 were in vitro and 40 in vivo. In vivo studies of the effects of nicotine in animals demonstrated widespread effects on bone including osteoneogenesis, osseointegration, steady-state skeletal bone and genes and cytokines relevant to bone cell physiology and bone homeostasis. In these studies, nicotine's effects are predominately negative, inhibiting bone cell metabolism and fracture repair, whereas most in vitro studies reported biphasic responses in all bone cells except osteoclastic cells. EXPERT OPINION: The review suggests that nicotine has effects on osteoneogenesis, osseointegration and steady-state skeletal bone in animal in vivo models, as well as effects on all 'bone cells', via several mechanisms in both animal and human cell in vitro studies. The effect of nicotine is dose-dependent, with higher concentrations having predominantly negative effects, whereas at low concentrations a stimulatory effect is seen. Stimulatory effects on certain cells may indicate a possible, limited therapeutic role; advice regarding smoking cessation perioperatively should remain due to the other harmful components of cigarette smoke, but there may be scope for allowing the use of nicotine patches instead of complete abstention.

These results suggest that the NQ and AQ may participate in the pro-inflammatory responses through releasing different types of cytokines/chemokines.", "anno": [[81, 82, true], [230, 231, true], [359, 360, true], [567, 568, true], [628, 629, true], [844, 845, true], [990, 991, true], [1114, 1115, true], [1176, 1177, true], [1268, 1269, true], [1418, 1419, true]]}, {"id": 23415610, "text": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an incurable disease which affects millions of people in industrialized countries. Anecdotal and scientific evidence suggests that Cannabis use may have a positive impact in IBD patients. Here, we investigated the effect of cannabigerol (CBG), a non-psychotropic Cannabis-derived cannabinoid, in a murine model of colitis. Colitis was induced in mice by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (DNBS). Inflammation was assessed by evaluating inflammatory markers/parameters (colon weight/colon length ratio and myeloperoxidase activity), by histological analysis and immunohistochemistry; interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-10 and interferon-\u03b3 levels by ELISA, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by western blot and RT-PCR; CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity by a colorimetric assay. Murine macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells were used to evaluate the effect of CBG on nitric oxide production and oxidative stress, respectively. CBG reduced colon weight/colon length ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, and iNOS expression, increased SOD activity and normalized interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-10 and interferon-\u03b3 changes associated to DNBS administration. In macrophages, CBG reduced nitric oxide production and iNOS protein (but not mRNA) expression. Rimonabant (a CB1 receptor antagonist) did not change the effect of CBG on nitric oxide production, while SR144528 (a CB2 receptor antagonist) further increased the inhibitory effect of CBG on nitric oxide production. In conclusion, CBG attenuated murine colitis, reduced nitric oxide production in macrophages (effect being modulated by the CB2 receptor) and reduced ROS formation in intestinal epithelial cells. CBG could be considered for clinical experimentation in IBD patients.", "anno": [[117, 118, true], [222, 223, true], [357, 358, true], [457, 458, true], [871, 872, true], [1025, 1026, true], [1246, 1247, true], [1342, 1343, true], [1560, 1561, true], [1756, 1757, true], [1826, 1827, true]]}]}
