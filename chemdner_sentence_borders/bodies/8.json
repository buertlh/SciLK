This might slow down the first step of pre-receptor metabolism, the conversion of progesterone to 5\u03b1-dihydroprogestrone by SRD5A1, and it might also affect further reduction of 3-keto and 20-keto groups catalyzed by AKR1C2 and AKR1C3. Similarly favorable effects were seen for dienogest, which promoted significant reduction of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 expression and also showed no effect on PR-B protein levels. Different effects were seen for progesterone, which significantly decreased SRD5A1, PR-B and HSD17B2 protein levels. In contrast, treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate resulted in increased AKR1C1 expression and decreased levels of PR-B, which might lead to enhanced progesterone metabolism and reduced signaling through progesterone receptors.

Thus, BNP and CNP3 can act locally on cardiac myocytes in a paracrine/autocrine fashion. Double knockdown of BNP/OLGC7 genes impaired ventricular development by causing hypoplasia of ventricular myocytes as evidenced by reduced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation.

Then again, other examples of substrate ambiguity may indicate as yet unexplored regulatory systems. For example, bacterial Ap(4)A hydrolases also efficiently remove pyrophosphate from the 5' termini of mRNAs, suggesting a potential role for Ap(4)A in the control of bacterial mRNA turnover, while the ability of some eukaryotic mRNA decapping enzymes to degrade IDP and dIDP or diphosphoinositol polyphosphates (DIPs) may also be indicative of new regulatory networks in RNA metabolism. DIP phosphohydrolases also degrade diadenosine polyphosphates and inorganic polyphosphates, suggesting further avenues for investigation. This article uses these and other examples to highlight the need for a greater awareness of the possible significance of substrate ambiguity among the nudix hydrolases as well as the need to exert caution when interpreting incomplete analyses.", "anno": [[224, 225, true], [412, 413, true], [542, 543, true], [805, 806, true], [916, 917, true], [1017, 1018, true], [1404, 1405, true], [1542, 1543, true], [1786, 1787, true]]}, {"id": 23184951, "text": "Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) is a member of the RIG-I-like receptor family of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors that detect molecular signatures of virus infection and initiate antiviral signal transduction cascades.

Quantitative analysis of the dsRNA binding and enzymatic activities of LGP2 revealed high dsRNA-independent ATP hydrolysis activity. Biochemical assays and single-molecule analysis of LGP2 and mutant variants that dissociate basal from dsRNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis demonstrate that LGP2 utilizes basal ATP hydrolysis to enhance and diversify its RNA recognition capacity, enabling the protein to associate with intrinsically poor substrates.

The involvement of Ngb in other brain cell populations, as well as in other neuroprotective effects of E(2) , is completely unknown at present. We demonstrate Ngb immunoreactivity in reactive astrocytes located in the proximity of a penetrating cortical injury in vivo and the involvement of Ngb in the E(2) -mediated anti-inflammatory effect in primary cortical astrocytes.

Both hormones and their receptors may be relevant in certain human and rodent cancers, including breast cancer.

Furthermore, GHR and PRLR associate in a fashion augmented acutely by GH, even though GH primarily activates PRLR, rather than GHR, in these cells. To better understand PRLR's impact, we examined the effects of PRLR knockdown on GHR availability and GH sensitivity in T47D cells. T47D-ShPRLR cells, in which PRLR expression was reduced by stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression, were compared with T47D-SCR control cells. PRLR knockdown decreased the rate of GHR proteolytic turnover, yielding GHR protein increase and ensuing sensitization of these cells to GHR signaling events including phosphorylation of GHR, Janus kinase 2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Unlike in T47D-SCR cells, acute GH signaling in T47D-ShPRLR cells was not blocked by the PRLR antagonist G129R but was inhibited by the GHR-specific antagonist, anti-GHR(ext-mAb). Thus, GH's use of GHR rather than PRLR was manifested when PRLR was reduced. In contrast to acute effects, GH incubation for 2 h or longer yielded diminished STAT5 phosphorylation in T47D-ShPRLR cells compared with T47D-SCR, a finding perhaps explained by markedly greater GH-induced GHR down-regulation in cells with diminished PRLR. However, when stimulated with repeated 1-h pulses of GH separated by 3-h washout periods to more faithfully mimic physiological GH pulsatility, T47D-ShPRLR cells exhibited greater transactivation of a STAT5-responsive luciferase reporter than did T47D-SCR cells.

Mechanistically, we show that Rnf4 targets SUMOylated MDC1 and SUMOylated BRCA1, and is required for the loading of Rad51, an enzyme required for HR repair, onto sites of DNA damage. Similarly to inactivating mutations in other key regulators of HR repair, Rnf4 deficiency leads to age-dependent impairment in spermatogenesis.

EENs are artificial nucleases designed to target and cleave specific DNA sequences. EENs have been shown to be a very useful genetic tool for targeted genome modification and have shown great potentials in the applications in basic research, clinical therapies and agricultural utilities, and they are specifically essential for reverse genetics research in species where no other gene targeting techniques are available. EENdb contains over 700 records of all the reported ZFNs and TALENs and related information, such as their target sequences, the peptide components [zinc finger protein-/transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-binding domains, FokI variants and linker peptide/framework], the efficiency and specificity of their activities. The database also lists EEN engineering tools and resources as well as information about forms and types of EENs, EEN screening and construction methods, detection methods for targeting efficiency and many other utilities. The aim of EENdb is to represent a central hub for EEN information and an integrated solution for EEN engineering. These studies may help to extract in-depth properties and common rules regarding ZFN or TALEN efficiency through comparison of the known ZFNs or TALENs.", "anno": [[298, 299, true], [382, 383, true], [720, 721, true], [1049, 1050, true], [1272, 1273, true], [1387, 1388, true], [1540, 1541, true]]}, {"id": 23203920, "text": "With the widespread occurrence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, the development of new strategies beyond conventional treatments is a pursuit taken by public health institutions worldwide. LasR, a transcription factor that controls quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for the next generation of antimicrobial agents. In the present study, a virtual screening workflow combining pharmacophore- and structure-based approaches was used to identify new LasR ligands. Five novel inducers and three inhibitors of LasR activity were validated experimentally by use of a cell-based assay. Interestingly, these compounds are molecularly distinct from the native signal molecule, N-3-oxododecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (OHN), and may serve as lead structures for the design of new drugs. The binding modes of these compounds to the OHN binding site in LasR were predicted and used to identify the key interactions that contribute to the induction and inhibition of LasR activity.", "anno": [[194, 195, true], [376, 377, true], [522, 523, true], [640, 641, true], [837, 838, true], [1029, 1030, true]]}, {"id": 23204325, "text": "The increased insulin secretory burden placed on pancreatic \u03b2-cells during obesity and insulin resistance can ultimately lead to \u03b2-cell dysfunction and death and the development of type 2 diabetes. Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig6) is a cellular stress-responsive protein that can negatively regulate the duration and intensity of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and has been classically viewed as a molecular brake for proliferation. In this study, we used Mig6 heterozygous knockout mice (Mig6(+/-)) to study the role of Mig6 in regulating \u03b2-cell proliferation and survival. Surprisingly, the proliferation rate of Mig6(+/-) pancreatic islets was lower than wild-type islets despite having comparable \u03b2-cell mass and glucose tolerance. We thus speculated that Mig6 regulates cellular death. Using adenoviral vectors to overexpress or knockdown Mig6, we found that caspase 3 activation during apoptosis was dependent on the level of Mig6. Interestingly, Mig6 expression was induced during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and its protein levels were maintained throughout ER stress. Using polyribosomal profiling, we identified that Mig6 protein translation was maintained, whereas the global protein translation was inhibited during ER stress. In addition, Mig6 overexpression exacerbated ER stress-induced caspase 3 activation in vitro. In conclusion, Mig6 is transcriptionally up-regulated and resistant to global translational inhibition during stressed conditions in \u03b2-cells and mediates apoptosis in the form of caspase 3 activation. The sustained production of Mig6 protein exacerbates ER stress-induced \u03b2-cell death. Thus, preventing the induction, translation, and/or function of Mig6 is warranted for increasing \u03b2-cell survival.", "anno": [[196, 197, true], [442, 443, true], [584, 585, true], [745, 746, true], [800, 801, true], [947, 948, true], [1093, 1094, true], [1255, 1256, true], [1349, 1350, true], [1550, 1551, true], [1635, 1636, true], [1749, 1750, true]]}]}
