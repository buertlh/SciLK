Recent studies have demonstrated that aquatic insects biotransport MeHg and other contaminants to terrestrial consumers, but the factors that regulate the flux of MeHg out of aquatic ecosystems via emergent insects have not been studied. The authors used experimental mesocosms to test the hypothesis that insect emergence and the associated flux of MeHg from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems is affected by both bottom-up nutrient effects and top-down fish consumer effects. In the present study, nutrient addition led to an increase in MeHg flux primarily by enhancing the biomass of emerging insects whose tissues were contaminated with MeHg, whereas fish decreased MeHg flux primarily by reducing the biomass of emerging insects. Furthermore, the authors found that these factors are interdependent such that the effects of nutrients are more pronounced when fish are absent, and the effects of fish are more pronounced when nutrient concentrations are high. The present study is the first to demonstrate that the flux of MeHg from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems is strongly enhanced by bottom-up nutrient effects and diminished by top-down consumer effects.", "anno": [[137, 138, true], [375, 376, true], [614, 615, true], [872, 873, true], [1101, 1102, true], [1304, 1305, true]]}, {"id": 23225346, "text": "Potency with potential: 2-Phenoxy-nicotinamides were identified as potent agonists at the GPBAR1 receptor, a target in the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

Different concentrations of sodium pentaborate pentahydrate (NaB) were prepared for the analysis of cell toxicity and differentiation evaluations. The odontogenic, osteogenic differentiation and biomineralization of human tooth germ stem cells (hTGSCs) were evaluated by analyzing the mRNA expression levels, odontogenic and osteogenic protein expressions, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization, and calcium deposits. The NaB-treated group displayed the highest ALP activity and expression of osteo- and odontogenic-related genes and proteins compared to the other groups and baseline. In the current study, increased in vitro odontogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity of hTGSCs by NaB application has been shown for the first time.

RESULTS: The ED50 value of nicotine to produce discriminative stimulus effects systematically increased as training dose increased. Varenicline and cytisine did not fully substitute for nicotine and, as compared with nicotine, their ED50 values varied less systematically as a function of nicotine training dose. Morphine did not substitute for nicotine, whereas midazolam substituted for the low and not the higher training doses of nicotine. As training dose increased, the dose of mecamylamine needed to produce a significant rightward shift in the nicotine dose-effect function also increased.

Jacaric acid induced concentration- and time-depedent LNCaP cell death through activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways resulting in cleavage of PARP-1, modulation of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins and increased cleavage of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Moreover, activation of a cell death-inducing signalling cascade involving death receptor 5 was observed. Jacaric acid induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells by activation of the intrinsic pathway only.

Cis-hinokiresinol, a naturally occurring phenylpropanoid, was previously reported to possess anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and estrogen-like activities. In the present study, we investigated anti-ischemic effects of trans- and cis-hinokiresinols using in\u00a0vitro as well as in\u00a0vivo experimental models. The ORAC and DPPH assays showed that two isomers had similar free radical scavenging activities. However, only trans-hinokiresinol significantly decreased neuronal injury in cultured cortical neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (75\u00a0min) followed by re-oxygenation (9\u00a0h). The differential neuroprotective effect could be due to the stereo-specific augmentation of Cu/Zn-SOD activity by trans-hinokiresinol, when compared with cis-hinokiresinol. Similarly, in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (1.5\u00a0h) followed by 24-h reperfusion, pre-ischemic treatment with trans-hinokiresinol, but not with cis-isomer, reduced cerebral infarct volume. Interestingly, however, post-ischemic treatment with both hinokiresinols (2 and 7\u00a0h after onset of ischemia) significantly reduced cerebral infarct. When administered after onset of ischemia, trans-hinokiresinol, but not its cis-isomer reduced nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in ischemic regions. In contrast, both hinokiresinols suppressed neutrophil infiltration and IL-1\u03b2 release to a similar extent. The observed differential anti-oxidant, but comparable anti-inflammatory, activities may explain the stereo-specific anti-ischemic activities and different therapeutic time windows of the hinokiresinols examined.

Diets deficient in iodine were prepared by adding 975, 200, 125, 25, or 0 \u00b5g/kg potassium iodate to the base casein diet to produce five nominal iodine levels ranging from ample (Diet 1: 1000 \u03bcg iodine/kg chow, D1) to deficient (Diet 5: 25 \u00b5g iodine/kg chow, D5). Female Long Evans rats were maintained on these diets beginning 7 weeks prior to breeding until the end of lactation. Dams were sacrificed on gestational days 16 and 20, or when pups were weaned on postnatal day (PN) 21. Fetal tissue was harvested from the dams, and pups were sacrificed on PN14 and PN21. Blood, thyroid gland, and brain were collected for analysis of iodine, TH, and TH precursors and metabolites. Serum and thyroid gland iodine and TH were reduced in animals receiving two diets that were most deficient in iodine. T4 was reduced in the fetal brain but was not altered in the neonatal brain. Neurobehavior, assessed by acoustic startle, water maze learning, and fear conditioning, was unchanged in adult offspring, but excitatory synaptic transmission was impaired in the dentate gyrus in animals receiving two diets that were most deficient in iodine. A 15% reduction in cortical T4 in the fetal brain was sufficient to induce permanent reductions in synaptic function in adults. These findings have implications for regulation of TH-disrupting chemicals and suggest that standard behavioral assays do not readily detect neurotoxicity induced by modest developmental TH disruption.", "anno": [[99, 100, true], [302, 303, true], [447, 448, true], [711, 712, true], [829, 830, true], [932, 933, true], [1017, 1018, true], [1127, 1128, true], [1245, 1246, true], [1322, 1323, true], [1583, 1584, true], [1711, 1712, true], [1913, 1914, true]]}, {"id": 23347089, "text": "Abstract Several studies report that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) able to interfere with endocrine homeostasis may affect women's reproductive health.

First, we demonstrated that in normal prostate epithelium, AR co-localizes with PAK6 in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus in malignant prostate. Furthermore, AR phosphorylation at Ser-578 by PAK6 promotes AR-E3 ligase murine double minute-2 (Mdm2) association, causing AR degradation upon androgen stimuli.

PAK6 knockdown promotes prostate tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, we found a strong inverse correlation between PAK6 and AR expression in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells.

The MO was determined using the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III classification with Korean-specific cutoffs for abdominal obesity. Therefore, a total of 856 subjects were categorized as follows: (1) metabolically healthy and normal weight (MHNW); (2) metabolically obese but normal weight (MONW); (3) metabolically healthy but obese (MHO); and (4) metabolically abnormally obese (MAO). The presence of obstructive lesion\u226550% of coronary artery was considered as an angiographic CAD and the Gensini scoring system was used for the severity. RESULTS: MONW or MO showed a higher prevalence of CAD than MHNW or non-MO after adjustment for age and sex, respectively (MONW, odds ratio [OR]=1.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-2.51 and MO, OR=1.44, 95% CI: 1.09-1.91).

Because both inhibition and overactivation of the ISR can induce tumor cell death, modulators of ATF4 expression could prove to be clinically useful. In this study, chemical libraries were screened for modulators of ATF4 expression.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the uncatalyzed reaction give high barriers and almost no regioselectivity even when adding two water molecules to assist the proton transfer. According to quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations on the full solvated protein, the enzyme-catalyzed glutathione addition reaction involves two major chemical steps that both proceed in the sextet state: proton transfer from the GSH thiol group to the Tyr39 anion and nucleophilic attack by the GSH thiolate leading to epoxide ring-opening. The second step is rate-limiting and is facilitated by the presence of the high-spin Mn(2+) ion that functions as a Lewis acid and stabilizes the leaving oxyanion through direct coordination. The barrier for C1 attack is computed to be 8.9 kcal/mol lower than that for C2 attack, in agreement with the experimentally observed regioselectivity of the enzyme. Further QM/MM calculations on the alternative water attack predict a concerted mechanism for this reaction, where the deprotonation of water, nucleophilic attack, and epoxide ring-opening take place via the same transition state.

The catalytic efficiency, regioselectivity, and chemoselectivity of FosA are rationalized in terms of the influence of the active-site protein environment and the different stabilization of the distorted substrates in the relevant transition states.", "anno": [[151, 152, true], [285, 286, true], [476, 477, true], [839, 840, true], [1031, 1032, true], [1197, 1198, true], [1427, 1428, true], [1662, 1663, true], [1912, 1913, true]]}, {"id": 22610748, "text": "This was a randomized, parallel, and placebo-controlled study. Forty subjects were divided into a test group and a placebo group. The study was focused on the potential effects of a mixture of Schisandra fruit extract and sesamin (hereinafter called 'SCH') in the subjects with borderline high levels (40-60 U/L) of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Twenty subjects taking SCH (four tablets per day) and 20 subjects taking a placebo (four tablets per day) were studied. The effects of SCH on ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, free radical levels, total antioxidant status, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and the lag time for low-density lipoprotein oxidation were determined. The total test period was 5\u2009months. Intervention of SCH clearly reduced the levels of ALT and AST, but it made no change in the total bilirubin and direct bilirubin. Intake of SCH also greatly increased the antioxidant capacity and decreased the values of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, total free radicals, and superoxide anion radicals in the plasma. The activities of glutathione peroxidase and reductase in the erythrocytes were significantly increased. In addition, the lag time for low-density lipoprotein oxidation, an inflammatory marker, was evidently increased. Fatty liver was found to have been significantly improved in this study. SCH proved to have the effects of antioxidation and improving liver function.

Indeed, ouabain (OUA), a potent blocker of the pump, is used to inhibit some PLTX effects in vitro. However, in an effort to explain incomplete inhibition of PLTX cytotoxicity, some studies suggest the possibility of two different binding sites on Na+/K+-ATPase. Hence, this study was performed to characterize PLTX binding to intact HaCaT keratinocytes and to investigate the ability of OUA to compete for this binding. PLTX binding to HaCaT cells was demonstrated by immunocytochemical analysis after 10 min exposure. An anti-PLTX monoclonal antibody-based ELISA showed that the binding was saturable and reversible, with a K(d) of 3 \u00d7 10-10 M. However, kinetic experiments revealed that PLTX binding dissociation was incomplete, suggesting an additional, OUA-insensitive, PLTX binding site. Competitive experiments suggested that OUA acts as a negative allosteric modulator against high PLTX concentrations (0.3-1.0 \u00d7 10-7 M) and possibly as a non-competitive antagonist against low PLTX concentrations (0.1-3.0 \u00d7 10-9 M). Antagonism was supported by PLTX cytotoxicity inhibition at OUA concentrations that displaced PLTX binding (1 \u00d7 10-5 M). However, this inhibition was incomplete, supporting the existence of both OUA-sensitive and -insensitive PLTX binding sites.", "anno": [[130, 131, true], [230, 231, true], [393, 394, true], [551, 552, true], [650, 651, true], [777, 778, true], [924, 925, true], [1156, 1157, true], [1277, 1278, true], [1402, 1403, true]]}, {"id": 23603478, "text": "Recent studies suggest that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may form a risk factor for obesity by altering energy metabolism through epigenetic gene regulation. The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of a range of EDCs with putative obesogenic properties on global DNA methylation and adipocyte differentiation in vitro.

A modest decrease in global DNA methylation was observed in N2A cells exposed to 10\u03bcM DES, BPA, TCDD, BDE-47, PCB-153 and 1\u03bcM HCB, but no changes were found in the human SK-N-AS cells. We reveal for the first time that BDE-47 increases adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner (2.5-25\u03bcM). Adipocyte differentiation was also enhanced by TBT (\u2a7e10nM) and BPA (>10\u03bcM) and inhibited by TCDD (\u2a7e0.1nM). The other chemicals showed either modest or no effects on adipocyte differentiation at the concentrations tested (PFOA, PFOS and HBCD at 10\u03bcM; PCB-153, 3.4\u03bcM and HCB, 1\u03bcM).

Herein, the toxic interaction of GV with bovine hemoglobin (BHb) was investigated by a series of spectroscopic methods and molecular modeling method. The fluorescence emission profile exhibited a remarkable quenching upon addition of GV to the buffered aqueous solution of BHb and the analysis of results revealed the dominant role of static quenching mechanism in GV-BHb interaction. The negative \u0394H and positive \u0394S values demonstrated that the electrostatic interactions mainly stabilized this toxicant-protein complex. Synchronous fluorescence, UV-vis absorption and CD spectroscopic studies proved that the conformational change of BHb was induced by GV's combination. Molecular modeling studies exhibited the binding mode of GV-BHb complex and the detailed information of related driving forces. During the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR) study, the chemical shift perturbation and spin-lattice relaxation times of different protons were further used to investigate the interaction of GV with BHb and the results indicated that GV bound orientationally to BHb.", "anno": [[116, 117, true], [253, 254, true], [403, 404, true], [638, 639, true], [775, 776, true], [926, 927, true], [1054, 1055, true], [1334, 1335, true]]}, {"id": 23511348, "text": "We present a programmable, biocompatible technique for dynamically concentrating and patterning particles and cells in a microfluidic device.

The optoacoustic tweezers are capable of concentrating particles/cells at any prescribed locations in a microfluidic chamber without the use of permanent structures, rendering it particularly useful for the formation of flexible, complex cell patterns. Additionally, this technique has demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and can be conveniently integrated with other microfluidic units. In our experiments, micro-bubbles were generated by focusing a 405 nm diode laser onto a gold-coated glass chamber. By properly tuning the laser, we demonstrate precise control over the position and size of the generated bubbles. Acoustic waves were then applied to activate the surface bubbles, causing them to oscillate at an optimized frequency. The resulting acoustic radiation force allowed us to locally trap particles/cells, including 15 \u03bcm polystyrene beads and HeLa cells, around each bubble.
