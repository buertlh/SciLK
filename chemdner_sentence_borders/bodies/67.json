Hence, inclusion of antioxidants in protein formulations is of great interest. In this study, using recombinant human insulin (insulin) as a model, we investigated the ability of several excipients, in particular triethylenetetramine (TETA), reduced glutathione(GSH) and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), for their ability to prevent protein oxidation, aggregation, and fragmentation. Insulin (1mg/ml) was oxidized with 40\u03bcM Cu(2+) and 4mM ascorbic acid in absence or presence of excipients. Among the excipients studied, 1mM of TETA, EDTA, or GSH prevented insulin aggregation upon metal catalyzed oxidation (MCO) for 3h at room temperature, based on size exclusion chromatography (SEC). At lower concentration (100\u03bcM), for 72h at +4\u00b0C, TETA was the only one to inhibit almost completely oxidation-induced insulin aggregation, fragmentation, and structural changes, as indicated by SEC, nanoparticle tracking analysis, light obscuration particle counting, intrinsic/extrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism, and chemical derivatization. In contrast, GSH had a slight pro-oxidant effect, as demonstrated by the higher percentage of aggregates and a more severe structural damage, whereas EDTA offered substantially less protection. TETA also protected a monoclonal IgG1 against MCO-induced aggregation, suggesting its general applicability.

Although glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and arsenic methyltransferase have been shown or thought to catalyze DMAs(V) reduction, their role in DMAs(V) reduction in vivo, or in cell extracts is uncertain. Therefore, the reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) in rats and in rat liver cytosol was studied to better understand its mechanism. To assess DMAs(V) reduction in rats, a novel procedure was devised based on following the accumulation of red blood cell (RBC)-bound dimethylarsenic (DMAs), which represents DMAs(III), in the blood of DMAs(V)-injected anesthetized rats. These studies indicated that rats reduced DMAs(V) to DMAs(III) to a significant extent, as in 90 min 31% of the injected 50 \u03bcmol/kg DMAs(V) dose was converted to DMAs(III) that was sequestered by the circulating erythrocytes. Pretreatment of rats with glutathione (GSH) depletors (phorone or BSO) delayed the elimination of DMAs(V) and the accumulation of RBC-bound DMAs, whereas the indirect methyltransferase inhibitor periodate-oxidized adenosine was without effect. Assessment of DMAs(V)-reducing activity of rat liver cytosol revealed that reduction of DMAs(V) required cytosolic protein and GSH and was inhibited by thiol reagents, GSSG and dehydroascorbate. Although thioredoxin reductase (TRR) inhibitors (aurothioglucose and Sb(III)) inhibited cytosolic DMAs(V) reduction, recombinant rat TRR plus NADPH, alone or when added to the cytosol, failed to support DMAs(V) reduction. On ultrafiltration of the cytosol through a 3 kDa filter, the reducing activity in the retentate was lost but was largely restored by NADPH. Such experiments also suggested that the reducing enzyme was larger than 100 kDa and was not GSTO1.

However, in preclinical studies of mGluR5 compounds tested in our laboratory and others, increased locomotion following mGluR5 modulation has been observed. Understanding the influence of general activity on sociability and repetitive behaviors will increase the accuracy of interpretations of positive outcomes measured from pharmacological treatment that produces locomotor activating or sedating effects. In the present studies, dose-response curves for d-amphetamine (AMPH)-induced hyperlocomotion were similar in standard B6 mice and in the BTBR mouse model of autism. AMPH produced significant, robust reductions in the high level of repetitive self-grooming that characterizes BTBR, and also reduced the low baseline grooming in B6, indicating that AMPH-induced hyperlocomotion competes with time spent engaged in self-grooming. We then tested AMPH in B6 and BTBR on the 3-chambered social approach task. One component of sociability, the time spent in the chamber with the novel mouse, in B6 mice was reduced, while the sniffing time component of sociability in BTBR mice was enhanced. This finding replicated across multiple cohorts treated with AMPH and saline vehicle. In-depth analysis revealed that AMPH increased the number and decreased the duration of sniffing bouts in BTBR, suggesting BTBR treated with AMPH mostly engaged in brief sniffs rather than true social interactions with the novel mouse during the social approach task.

Thus, active enantiomers of FPR2 agonists can be in either R- or S-configurations, depending on the molecular scaffold and specific substituents at the chiral center.

The second step is a cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent oxidation of this thiolactone resulting in the formation of a sulfenic acid that is eventually reduced into the corresponding active thiol. It has been postulated that the sulfenic acid metabolite resulted from a nucleophilic attack of water on a highly reactive thiolactone sulfoxide derived from P450-dependent oxidation of the thiolactone primary metabolite. The data described in the present article are in complete agreement with this proposition as they show that it was possible to trap these thiolactone sulfoxides by a series of nucleophiles such as amines, thiols, or cyclopentane-1,3-dione (CPDH), an equivalent of dimedone that is used as a sulfenic acid trapping agent. HPLC-MS studies showed that various bis-adducts having incorporated two nucleophile molecules were formed in these reactions.

Condensates of mainstream smoke from hand-rolled tobacco and marijuana cigarettes were similarly prepared using identical smoking conditions. Murine lung epithelial cells were exposed to low, medium and high concentrations of the smoke condensates for 6h. RNA was extracted immediately or after a 4h recovery period and hybridized to mouse whole genome microarrays. Tobacco smoke condensate (TSC) exposure was associated with changes in xenobiotic metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage response. These same pathways were also significantly affected following marijuana smoke condensate (MSC) exposure. Although the effects of the condensates were largely similar, dose-response analysis indicates that the MSC is substantially more potent than TSC. In addition, steroid biosynthesis, apoptosis, and inflammation pathways were more significantly affected following MSC exposure, whereas M phase cell cycle pathways were more significantly affected following TSC exposure.

In Parkinson's disease, synaptic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses is altered. Dendrites of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) receive dopaminergic inputs from the substantia nigra and glutamatergic cortical afferents. Because both glutamate and dopamine are required to induce and sustain MSNs plasticity, the particular molecular mechanisms involved at this synaptic triad are difficult to understand. In the present work, we established a convenient in vitro model of the corticostriatal synapse to study synaptic plasticity. We focused on long-term depression involving group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. We found that in striatal neurons co-cultured with cortical neurons, the absence of dopaminergic stimuli favored the excess of glutamatergic drive from cortical neuron terminals, thus resulting in a constitutive depression of the corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission. Indeed, concomitant blockade of group I mGlu receptors and activation of dopaminergic receptors stably reduced the depression of the synaptic transmission. Thus the dependence on glutamate and dopamine balance of the corticostriatal synapse responsiveness validates the accuracy of this manageable in vitro model to depict the molecular pathways involved in the plasticity at corticostriatal synapses and to test restorative therapeutic approaches in Parkinson's disease.

X-ray photoelectron and infrared spectroscopy support the theory that Bioglass surface was modified not just through contact with the solutions in scaffold fabrication, but upon an interaction with the polymeric matrix.

Righting recovery from the knockdown state was clearly compromised in the isoamyl nitrite-treated animals, the effect being attributable to the toxicity of the isoamyl alchol produced during hydrolysis of the isoamyl nitrite to release nitrite anion. Subsequently, inhaled aqueous sodium nitrite aerosol was demonstrated to ameliorate sublethal cyanide toxicity, when provided to mice after the toxic dose, by the more rapid recovery of righting ability compared to that of the control animals given only the toxicant. Aerosolized sodium nitrite has thus been shown by these experiments to have promise as a better alternative to organic nitrites for development as an inhaled cyanide antidote.

METHODS: Seven adult rhesus monkeys, fitted with Actical\u00ae activity monitors, were trained to respond under a concurrent choice paradigm with food (three 1.0-g pellets) and cocaine (0.003-0.3\u00a0mg/kg) or saline presentation. For each monkey, the lowest preferred dose of cocaine (>80\u00a0% cocaine choice) was determined. Activity data were analyzed during lights out (2000-0600) to determine sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and total activity counts. Subsequently, the monkeys' sleep was disrupted (every hour during lights-out period) the night prior to food-cocaine choice sessions. RESULTS: Self-administration of the preferred dose of cocaine resulted in a significant decrease in sleep efficiency, with a significant increase in total lights-out activity. Sleep disruption significantly altered behavioral indices of sleep, similar to those seen following cocaine self-administration.

With MTT cell viability assay, LDH release, ROS generation, caspase-3 activity assay and Hoechst 33342/PI staining, we found that Sal B pretreatment provided significantly protection against ATO-induced cell death.

This study provides new insights for the development of anti-thyroid drugs, as well as for the synthesis of novel pharmacological tools designed to investigate iodide transport mechanisms at cellular and molecular levels.", "anno": [[146, 147, true], [214, 215, true], [318, 319, true], [459, 460, true], [607, 608, true], [701, 702, true], [923, 924, true]]}, {"id": 23267695, "text": "Understanding as well as rapidly screening the interaction of nanoparticles with cell membranes is of central importance for biological applications such as drug and gene delivery. Recently, we have shown that \"striped\" mixed-monolayer-coated gold nanoparticles spontaneously penetrate a variety of cell membranes through a passive pathway. Here, we report an electrical approach to screen and readily quantify the interaction between nanoparticles and bilayer lipid membranes. Membrane adsorption is monitored through the capacitive increase of suspended planar lipid membranes upon fusion with nanoparticles. We adopt a Langmuir isotherm model to characterize the adsorption of nanoparticles by bilayer lipid membranes and extract the partition coefficient, K, and the standard free energy gain by this spontaneous process, for a variety of sizes of cell-membrane-penetrating nanoparticles. We believe that the method presented here will be a useful qualitative and quantitative tool to determine nanoparticle interaction with lipid bilayers and consequently with cell membranes.", "anno": [[179, 180, true], [339, 340, true], [476, 477, true], [609, 610, true], [891, 892, true], [1080, 1081, true]]}, {"id": 23387306, "text": "The results of experimental studies of the valence electronic structure of tetrahydrofuran employing He I photoelectron spectroscopy as well as Electron Momentum Spectroscopy (EMS) have been reinterpreted on the basis of Molecular Dynamical simulations employing the classical MM3 force field and large-scale quantum mechanical simulations employing Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics in conjunction with the dispersion corrected \u03c9B97XD exchange-correlation functional. Analysis of the produced atomic trajectories demonstrates the importance of thermal deviations from the lowest energy path for pseudorotation, in the form of considerable variations of the ring-puckering amplitude. These deviations are found to have a significant influence on several outer-valence electron momentum distributions, as well as on the He I photoelectron spectrum.", "anno": [[469, 470, true], [684, 685, true], [848, 849, true]]}]}
