To reach that goal, we implemented high-throughput, non-lethal challenge tests to estimate individual hypoxia and heat tolerance as surrogate measures of their capacity to face natural contingencies.

The HTR is widely used as a behavioral assay for 5-HT(2A) activation and to probe for interactions between the 5-HT(2A) receptor and other transmitter systems. OBJECTIVE: High-speed video recordings were used to analyze the head movement that occurs during head twitches in C57BL/6J mice. Experiments were also conducted in C57BL/6J mice to determine whether a head-mounted magnet and a magnetometer coil could be used to detect the HTR induced by serotonergic hallucinations based on the dynamics of the response. RESULTS: Head movement during the HTR was highly rhythmic and occurred within a specific frequency range (mean head movement frequency of 90.3\u00a0Hz). Head twitches produced wave-like oscillations of magnetometer coil voltage that matched the frequency of head movement during the response. The magnetometer coil detected the HTR induced by the serotonergic hallucinogens 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI; 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) with extremely high sensitivity and specificity.

We now report that the ubiquitous autacoid and neuromodulator, histamine, induces substantial glutamate-activated calcium mobilization in mGlu(4)-expressing cells, an effect which is observed in the absence of co-expressed chimeric G proteins. This strong induction of calcium signaling downstream of glutamate activation of mGlu(4) depends upon the presence of H(1) histamine receptors. Interestingly, the potentiating effect of histamine activation does not extend to other mGlu(4)-mediated signaling events downstream of G(i/o) G proteins, such as cAMP inhibition, suggesting that the presence of G(q) coupled receptors such as H(1) may bias normal mGlu(4)-mediated G(i/o) signaling events.

The median number of vertebral fractures was higher for females (median 4; range 0 to 14) than for males (median 1, range 0 to 8) (P\u2009=\u20090.03). Lumbar spine areal bone mineral density was negatively associated with the severity of vertebral compression fractures, as reflected in the spine deformity index. Scoliosis was present in about 30% of pediatric patients but the Cobb angle was <30 degrees in all cases. The average final height z-score was -1.1, representing a deficit of 8 to 10\u2009cm compared to the general population. In summary, OI patients with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency mutations have high rates of significant skeletal involvement. Systematic follow up of growing patients with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency mutations including radiographic screening for vertebral compression fractures and scoliosis is warranted. \u00a9 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "anno": [[103, 104, true], [210, 211, true], [417, 418, true], [500, 501, true], [676, 677, true], [780, 781, true], [897, 898, true], [1039, 1040, true], [1202, 1203, true], [1308, 1309, true], [1424, 1425, true], [1542, 1543, true], [1721, 1722, true], [1776, 1777, true]]}, {"id": 22991246, "text": "Cement augmentation is a controversial treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCF).

The majority of ADHD-related treatments act either as dual norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) reuptake inhibitors (psychostimulants) or selective NE reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Certain benztropine analogs act as highly selective DA reuptake inhibitors while lacking the reinforcing actions, and thus abuse potential, of psychostimulants. To assess the potential use of these compounds in the treatment of ADHD, we examined the effects of a well-characterized benztropine analog, AHN 2-005, on performance of rats in a PFC-dependent delayed-alternation task of spatial working memory. Similar to that seen with all drugs currently approved for ADHD, AHN 2-005 dose-dependently improved performance in this task. Clinically-relevant doses of psychostimulants and SNRIs elevate NE and DA preferentially in the PFC. Despite the selectivity of this compound for the DA transporter, additional microdialysis studies demonstrated that a cognition-enhancing dose of AHN 2-005 that lacked locomotor activating effects increased extracellular levels of both DA and NE in the PFC. AHN 2-005 produced a larger increase in extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens, although the magnitude of this was well below that seen with motor activating doses of psychostimulants. Collectively, these observations suggest that benztropine analogs may be efficacious in the treatment of ADHD or other disorders associated with PFC dysfunction.

Controversy exists regarding the hypothesis that the hepatocyte injury is amplified by a sterile inflammatory response, rather than being the result of intracellular mechanisms alone. A recent study suggested that the purinergic receptor antagonist A438079 protects against APAP-induced liver injury by preventing the activation of the Nalp3 inflammasome in Kupffer cells and thereby preventing inflammatory injury. To test the hypothesis that A438079 actually affects the intracellular signaling events in hepatocytes, C57Bl/6 mice were treated with APAP (300 mg/kg) and A438079 (80 mg/kg) or saline and GSH depletion, protein adduct formation, c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, oxidant stress, and liver cell necrosis were determined between 0 and 6 h after APAP administration. APAP caused rapid GSH depletion, extensive protein adduct formation in liver homogenates and in mitochondria, JNK phosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of phospho-JNK within 2 h, oxidant stress, and extensive centrilobular necrosis at 6 h. A438079 significantly attenuated GSH depletion, which resulted in a 50% reduction of total liver and mitochondrial protein adducts and substantial reduction of JNK activation, mitochondrial P-JNK translocation, oxidant stress, and liver injury. The same results were obtained using primary mouse hepatocytes. A438079 did not directly affect JNK activation induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide and GSH depletion. However, A438079 dose-dependently inhibited hepatic P450 enzyme activity. Thus, the protective effect of A438079 against APAP hepatotoxicity in vivo can be explained by its effect on metabolic activation and cell death pathways in hepatocytes without involvement of the Nalp3 inflammasome.", "anno": [[100, 101, true], [284, 285, true], [516, 517, true], [889, 890, true], [1139, 1140, true], [1384, 1385, true], [1448, 1449, true], [1550, 1551, true], [1624, 1625, true], [1840, 1841, true]]}, {"id": 23395967, "text": "The activity of a family scorpiand-like azamacrocycles against Leishmania infantum and Leishmania braziliensis was studied using promastigotes, axenic and intracellular amastigotes forms.

We have examined the hypothesis that the formation of disulfide bonds in hSULT2A1 can reversibly regulate the catalytic function of the enzyme. Three thiol oxidants were used as model compounds to investigate their effects on homogeneous preparations of hSULT2A1: glutathione disulfide, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 1,1'-azobis(N,N-dimethylformamide) (diamide). Examination of the effects of disulfide bond formation with these agents indicated that the activity of the enzyme is reversibly altered.

The effects of these agents on the binding of substrates and products, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identification of the disulfides formed, and structural modeling of the modified enzyme were examined. Our results indicate that conformational changes at cysteines near the nucleotide binding site affect the binding of both the nucleotide and DHEA to the enzyme, with the specific effects dependent on the structure of the resulting disulfide.

Supported by case reports and the results of a limited number of studies there is an ongoing debate on the potential of PRG to cause addictive behaviours. However, currently available evidence on this issue is sparse, and any definitive assessment of PRG's potential for abuse and dependence is not yet in sight. The aim of our study was to identify the number of cases of PRG abuse or dependence reported to the database of a German medical regulatory body and to obtain insights into further usage-specific parameters. METHODS: We conducted a query of the entire database of the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) regarding reports of PRG abuse or dependence and analysed these cases on the basis of several parameters. RESULTS: A total of 55 reports of PRG abuse or dependence were identified (mean age 36\u00a0years, 64\u00a0% of reports involved males). The first reports were submitted to BfArM in 2008, and the reporting frequency has increased up to the present. Mean daily PRG dosage was 1424\u00a0mg.

In this work, a new strategy for creating virus-like proteoliposomes (VLPLs) and virus-like supported bilayers (VLSBs) is presented. This strategy uses a cell blebbing technique to induce the formation of nanoscale vesicles from the plasma membrane of BHK cells expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein of influenza X-31. These vesicles and supported bilayers contain HA and are used to carry out single particle membrane fusion events, monitored using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The results of these studies show that the VLPLs and VLSBs contain HA proteins that are fully competent to carry out membrane fusion, including the formation of a fusion pore and the release of fluorophores loaded into vesicles. This new strategy for creating spherical and planar geometry virus-like membranes has many potential applications.

Simulations using a target-mediated drug disposition model were performed to evaluate the influence of antibody-target binding affinity, baseline target concentration, and target turnover on magnitude and duration of soluble target inhibition. These simulations assumed intravenous dosing of the antibody and evaluated multiple parameters over a wide range. These simulations reveal that improvement in affinity reaches a point of diminishing returns following which further improvement in affinity does not alter the magnitude and more importantly the duration of target inhibition. Evaluation of unbound antibody and target kinetics indicated that point of diminishing returns in duration of inhibition was due to target-mediated binding and subsequent elimination of antibody at later time points.

These findings support a model in which reduced trimer stability causes these mutant PCNA proteins to occasionally undergo conformational changes that compromise their ability to stimulate TLS by both replicative and translesion polymerases.", "anno": [[147, 148, true], [265, 266, true], [408, 409, true], [524, 525, true], [624, 625, true], [798, 799, true], [948, 949, true], [1057, 1058, true], [1182, 1183, true], [1285, 1286, true], [1527, 1528, true]]}, {"id": 22577127, "text": "RETRACTED.", "anno": [[9, 10, true]]}, {"id": 23594342, "text": "Genistein is a phytochemical with a broad range of desirable biological activity for wound healing. However, its poor bioavailability requires developing a new method for fabricating an appropriate carrier vehicle to deliver genistein in a sustained manner. Based on the guidance afforded by the ternary phase diagram of poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PDLLA), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and genistein blends, certain selective compositions were electrospun. We obtained a uniformly smooth surface morphology in unmodified and genistein-modified PEO/PDLLA fibers, documented by scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, wide-angle X-ray diffraction and (1)H NMR studies revealed that the genistein molecules, successfully incorporated in the blends, remained chemically stable after electrospinning. Besides surface wettability and dimensional stability of the electrospun mats, the released genistein amount has been evaluated as a function of PEO concentration. Our biocompatibility investigations suggest that genistein-modified PEO/PDLLA electrospun mats exhibit strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities which indicate they have potential applications for wound dressings.", "anno": [[98, 99, true], [256, 257, true], [449, 450, true], [598, 599, true], [788, 789, true], [952, 953, true], [1176, 1177, true]]}]}
