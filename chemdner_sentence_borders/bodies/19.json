However, Pb(2+)-induced cardiotoxicity has never been investigated yet and the exact mechanism of Pb(2+) associated cardiotoxicity has not been studied. The current study was designed to investigate the potential effect of Pb(2+) to induce cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro rat model and to explore the molecular mechanisms and the role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and regulated gene, cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1), in Pb(2+)-mediated cardiotoxicity. For these purposes, Wistar albino rats were treated with Pb(2+) (25, 50 and 100mg/kg, i.p.) for three days and the effects on physiological and histopathological parameters of cardiotoxicity were determined. At the in vitro level, rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cell lines were incubated with increasing concentration of Pb(2+) (25, 50, and 100\u03bcM) and the expression of hypertrophic genes, \u03b1- and \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (\u03b1-MHC and \u03b2-MHC), brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), and CYP1A1 were determined at the mRNA and protein levels using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. The results showed that Pb(2+) significantly induced cardiotoxicity and heart failure as evidenced by increase cardiac enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase and changes in histopathology in vivo. In addition, Pb(2+) treatment induced \u03b2-MHC and BNP whereas inhibited \u03b1-MHC mRNA and protein levels in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, at the in vitro level, Pb(2+) treatment induced both \u03b2-MHC and \u03b1-MHC mRNA levels in time- and dose-dependent manner. Importantly, these changes were accompanied with a proportional increase in the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA and protein expression levels, suggesting a role for the CYP1A1 in cardiotoxicity. The direct evidence for the involvement of CYP1A1 in the induction of cardiotoxicity by Pb(2+) was evidenced by the ability of AhR antagonist, resveratrol, to significantly inhibit the Pb(2+)-modulated effect on \u03b2-MHC and \u03b1-MHC mRNAs.

During the centrifugal jet spinning process, a polymer solution jet is stretched by the centrifugal force of a rotating chamber. By engineering the rheological properties of the polymer solution, solvent evaporation rate and centrifugal force that are applied on the solution jet, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) composite fibers with various diameters are fabricated. Viscosity measurements of polymer solutions allowed us to determine critical polymer chain entanglement limits that allow the generation of continuous fiber as opposed to beads or beaded fibers. Above a critical concentration at which polymer chains are partially or fully entangled, lower polymer concentrations and higher centrifugal forces resulted in thinner fibers. Etching of PVP from the PLLA-PVP composite fibers doped with increasing PVP concentrations yielded PLLA fibers with increasing nano-scale surface roughness and porosity, which increased the fiber hydrophilicity dramatically.

In vitro hepatic transport of repaglinide, characterized using sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes, and intrinsic metabolic parameters were used to build a dynamic whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of paliperidone monotherapy as an acute treatment of mania and related symptoms in youth with bipolar spectrum disorders. METHODS: An 8-week, prospective, open-label paliperidone monotherapy trial to assess effectiveness and tolerability in treating pediatric bipolar spectrum and related disorders (depression, psychosis, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). Assessments included the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Adverse events were assessed through spontaneous self-reports, vital signs, weight monitoring, and laboratory analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen youth with bipolar spectrum disorders (YMRS at entry: 32.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1) were enrolled in the study and 11 (73\u00a0%) completed the 8-week trial. The total daily dose of paliperidone at study endpoint was 3\u00a0mg in 12 subjects and 6\u00a0mg in three subjects. Treatment with paliperidone was associated with statistically significant levels of improvement in mean YMRS scores (-18.7\u2009\u00b1\u200913.9, p\u2009<\u20090.001) at endpoint. Paliperidone treatment also resulted in significant improvement in the severity of ADHD and psychotic symptoms.

First, both pathways regulate the transcription and expression of own and reciprocal receptors: RA and Dex increased RAR\u03b2 and decreased GR expressions.

The GOAT inhibitor, GO-CoA-Tat, decreases the circulating concentrations of octanoylated ghrelin and attenuates weight gain on a high fat diet in mice. Unlike rats and mice, Siberian hamsters and humans do not increase food intake after food deprivation, but increase food hoarding after food deprivation. In Siberian hamsters, exogenous ghrelin increases ingestive behaviors similarly to 48-56h food deprivation. Therefore, we tested the necessity of increased ghrelin in food-deprived Siberian hamsters to stimulate ingestive behaviors. To do so we used our simulated natural housing system that allows hamsters to forage for and hoard food. Animals were given an injection of GO-CoA-Tat (i.p., 11\u03bcmol/kg) every 6h because that is the duration of its effective inhibition of octanoylated ghrelin concentrations during a 48h food deprivation. We found that GO-CoA-Tat attenuated food foraging (0-1h), food intake (0-1 and 2-4h), and food hoarding (0-1h and 2 and 3days) post-refeeding compared with saline treated animals. This suggests that increased octanoylated ghrelin concentrations play a role in the food deprivation-induced increases in ingestive behavior.

Longitudinal in vivo \u00b5CT scans demonstrated that individual mice lost between 15% and 71% in trabecular BV/TV in the distal femur during unloading (average: -43%). Changes in trabecular BV/TV during the 3wk reambulation period ranged from a continuation of bone loss (-18%) to large additions (56%) of tissue (average: +10%). During unloading, six QTLs accounted for 21% of the total variability in changes in BV/TV while one QTL accounted for 6% of the variability in changes in BV/TV during reambulation. QTLs were also identified for changes in trabecular architecture. Most of the QTLs defining morphologic changes during unloading or reambulation did not overlap with those QTLs identified at baseline, suggesting that these QTLs harbor genes that are specific for sensing changes in the levels of weightbearing. The lack of overlap in QTLs between unloading and reambulation also emphasizes that the genes modulating the trabecular response to unloading are distinct from those regulating tissue recovery during reloading. The identified QTLs contain the regulatory genes underlying the strong genetic regulation of trabecular bone's sensitivity to weightbearing and may help to identify individuals that are most susceptible to unloading induced bone loss and/or the least capable of recovering. \u00a9 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "anno": [[182, 183, true], [541, 542, true], [705, 706, true], [867, 868, true], [1048, 1049, true], [1114, 1115, true], [1359, 1360, true], [1570, 1571, true], [1844, 1845, true], [1899, 1900, true]]}, {"id": 23401084, "text": "The 2012 American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Certification Affairs Committee was charged with developing guidelines for the desired professional development pathways for clinical pharmacists.

Three petroleum distillate fractions, F2 (>C10-C16), F3a (>C16-C23), and F3b (>C23-C34), were used in two binary combinations, F2F3a and F3aF3b. In the toxicity study, clean soil was spiked with equitoxic combinations of the two distillates ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 toxic units. In the toxicokinetic study, a binary combination consisting of one concentration of each distillate was used. On a soil concentration basis, the toxicity of the binary combinations of distillates was less than additive. Accumulation of the individual distillates, however, was generally reduced when a second distillate was present, resulting in lower body burden. This is thought to be due to the presence of a nonaqueous-phase liquid at the soil concentrations used. On a tissue concentration basis, toxicity was closer to additive. The results demonstrate that tissue concentrations are the preferred metric for toxicity for earthworms.

Earthworms added to soils after plant harvest accumulated more DDE but were unaffected by the C60 exposure.

A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that histone H3 near the promoter was hypoacetylated in the kidney but was hyperacetylated in the liver; this hyperacetylation was accompanied by the recruitment of HNF1\u03b1 to the promoter.

In the present study, we investigated the ability of MFA to become bioactivated into the acyl-linked metabolite, mefenamyl-adenylate (MFA-AMP).

Our work highlights the importance and utilisation of HAC for understanding the epigenetic aspects of chromosome biology.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 13 February 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2012.296.", "anno": [[222, 223, true], [399, 400, true], [515, 516, true], [710, 711, true], [864, 865, true], [986, 987, true], [1093, 1094, true]]}, {"id": 23404062, "text": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Numerous investigations have indicated that hepatic encephalopathy (HE) alters the levels of various neurotransmitters. However, comprehensive data regarding the effects of CA1 opioidergic and dopaminergic (DAergic) systems on HE-induced amnesia are still lacking. METHODS: Following intra-dorsal hippocampal (CA1) injection of mu opioid and dopamine D1- and D2-like receptors antagonists in male mice, one-trial step-down and hole-board paradigms were used to assess memory and exploratory behaviors, respectively. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that HE impairs memory 24\u00a0days after bile duct ligation (BDL). Furthermore, while the higher dose of DA D1-like receptor antagonist (SCH23390, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse) induced amnesia and anxiogenic-like behaviors, mu receptor antagonist (naloxone: 0.0125, 0.025 and 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse) and DA D2-like receptor antagonist (sulpiride: 0.0625, 0.125 and 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse) by themselves, could not exert an effect on memory performance in passive avoidance task. On the other hand, pre-test injection of all drugs reversed the HE-induced amnesia 24\u00a0days after BDL, while having no effect on exploratory behaviors. Pre-test co-administration of the subthreshold dose SCH23390 (0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse) and sulpiride (0.0625\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse) or naloxone (0.0125\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse) could likewise reverse the BDL-induced amnesia. However, when the subthreshold sulpiride plus naloxone were co-administered, BDL-induced amnesia was not blocked. CONCLUSIONS: Memory performance is impaired 24\u00a0days post BDL and CA1 mu opioid and DA D1-like receptors antagonist synergistic effects are likely involved in this phenomenon.", "anno": [[18, 19, true], [138, 139, true], [283, 284, true], [292, 293, true], [534, 535, true], [543, 544, true], [628, 629, true], [1006, 1007, true], [1157, 1158, true], [1344, 1345, true], [1458, 1459, true], [1471, 1472, true], [1633, 1634, true]]}, {"id": 23404198, "text": "TRIM16 exhibits tumour suppressor functions by interacting with cytoplasmic vimentin and nuclear E2F1 proteins in neuroblastoma and squamous cell carcinoma cells, reducing cell migration and replication. Reduced TRIM16 expression in a range of human primary malignant tissues correlates with increased malignant potential. TRIM16 also induces apoptosis in breast and lung cancer cells, by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that overexpression of TRIM16 induces apoptosis in human breast cancer (MCF7) and neuroblastoma (BE(2)-C) cells, but not in non-malignant HEK293 cells. TRIM16 increased procaspase-2 protein levels in MCF7 and induced caspase-2 activity in both MCF7 and BE(2)-C cells. We show that TRIM16 and caspase-2 proteins directly interact in both MCF7 and BE(2)-C cells and co-localise in MCF7 cells. Most importantly, the induction of caspase-2 activity is required for TRIM16 to initiate apoptosis. Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which TRIM16 can promote apoptosis by directly modulating caspase-2 activity.", "anno": [[202, 203, true], [321, 322, true], [407, 408, true], [572, 573, true], [688, 689, true], [811, 812, true], [911, 912, true], [1027, 1028, true]]}]}
