Here, we compare a lipid-based transfection method, lipofection, with an electroporation method, nucleofection, and find large, unanticipated and cell line-dependent differences in percent end-joining without recognizable trends. For example, in rodent cells, transfection using lipofection gives nearly WT end-joining in DNA-PKcs mutants and only mildly inhibited end-joining in Lig4 and Ku mutants.

To understand the development of AVM resistance in invertebrates, we investigated the mechanisms by which AVM affected P-gp expression in Drosophila S2 cells. We found that AVM induced upregulation of P-gp protein expression, increased P-gp ATPase activity and enhanced cellular efflux of the P-gp substrate rhodamine 123 from cells. Furthermore, we observed that AVM-induced expression of P-gp was due to elevation of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i).

These results are supported by our observations that verapamil, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, and niflumic acid, a chloride channel antagonist, significantly attenuated AVM-induced [Ca(2+)]i elevation, thereby reducing P-gp expression. Inhibition of P-gp with anti-P-gp antibody or cyclosporine A (a P-gp inhibitor) reduced the AVM-induced elevation of [Ca(2+)]i, implying that P-gp and [Ca(2+)]i regulate each other.

The metabolic pathway autophagy has been implicated in the regulation of survival in GBM. However, the status of autophagy in GBM and its role in the cancer stem cell fraction is currently unclear. We found that a number of autophagy regulators are highly expressed in GBM tumors carrying a mesenchymal signature, which defines aggressiveness and invasion, and are associated with components of the MAPK pathway. This autophagy signature included the autophagy-associated genes DRAM1 and SQSTM1, which encode a key regulator of selective autophagy, p62. High levels of DRAM1 were associated with shorter overall survival in GBM patients. In GSCs, DRAM1 and SQSTM1 expression correlated with activation of MAPK and expression of the mesenchymal marker c-MET. DRAM1 knockdown decreased p62 localization to autophagosomes and its autophagy-mediated degradation, thus suggesting a role for DRAM1 in p62-mediated autophagy. In contrast, autophagy induced by starvation or inhibition of mTOR/PI-3K was not affected by either DRAM1 or p62 downregulation. Functionally, DRAM1 and p62 regulate cell motility and invasion in GSCs. This was associated with alterations of energy metabolism, in particular reduced ATP and lactate levels.

By serendipity, we noted an opposite response to unloading in the proximal rat tibia. Therefore, we hypothesized that Sost-expression in response to changes in mechanical load is bone site specific. One hind limb of male, 3 month old rats was unloaded by paralyzing the extensors with Botulinium toxin A (Botox) injections. A series of experiments compared the expression of Sost mRNA in the unloaded and contralateral, loaded limbs, after 3 or 10 days, in metaphyseal cancellous bone, metaphyseal cortical bone, and diaphyseal cortical bone. We also conducted \u03bcCT to confirm changes in bone volume density related to unloading. Sost mRNA expression in the cancellous metaphyseal bone was downregulated almost 2-fold, both 3 days and 10 days after unloading (P<0.05). A similar tendency was seen in the metaphyseal cortical bone, in which Sost was 1.5-fold downregulated (P<0.05) after 10days, but not significantly changed after 3days. In contrast, diaphyseal cortical Sost expression was instead upregulated 1.4-fold (P<0.05) following 3-day unloading, while there was no significant change after 10days. Cancellous bone volume density was 58% lower (P<0.001, compared to cage controls) in the unloaded limb but not significantly affected in the loaded limb. The results suggest that Sost mRNA expression in metaphyseal bone responds to mechanical unloading in an opposite direction to that observed in diaphyseal cortical bone.

In addition, the cellular association of liposome/PEI was examined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. PEI showed higher antiviral activity postinfection than preinfection in vivo. Liposome/PEI and PEI with decreased numbers of primary amine residues at a dose of 0.2 mg PEI/mouse exhibited more potent therapeutic antiviral activity than acyclovir and PEI alone without acute lesion appearance or toxicity pre- or postinfection, but polyallylamine was moderately effective only preinfection. Liposome concentrations were important for the effectiveness of liposome/PEI. This finding suggests that PEI combined with liposomes and with slightly decreased numbers of primary amines may be an effective vaginally administrated antiviral drug, and secondary and tertiary amine residues of PEI may contribute to the inhibitory efficiency against viral infection.", "anno": [[166, 167, true], [300, 301, true], [525, 526, true], [747, 748, true], [996, 997, true], [1106, 1107, true], [1184, 1185, true], [1496, 1497, true], [1574, 1575, true], [1861, 1862, true]]}, {"id": 23567039, "text": "Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides from cyanobacteria which are responsible for poisonings of livestock and humans.

However, in these models hyperglycaemia has been induced early on in life and the treatment periods have been short. To explore the long-term effects of DPP4 inhibition on insulin secretion and beta cell mass, we have generated a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced-obesity model in mice of advanced age (10\u00a0months old). METHODS: After 1\u00a0month of HFD alone, the mice were given the DPP4 inhibitor vildagliptin for a further 11\u00a0months. At multiple time points throughout the study, OGTTs were performed and beta cell area and long-term survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Beta cell function and glucose tolerance were significantly improved by vildagliptin with both diets. In contrast, in spite of the long treatment period, beta cell area was not significantly different between vildagliptin-treated mice and controls. Mice of advanced age chronically fed an HFD displayed clear and extensive pancreatic inflammation and peri-insulitis, mainly formed by CD3-positive T cells, which were completely prevented by vildagliptin treatment. Chronic vildagliptin treatment also improved survival rates for HFD-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In a unique advanced-aged HFD-induced-obesity mouse model, insulin secretion was improved and the extensive peri-insulitis prevented by chronic DPP4 inhibition.

We conducted a literature search of all available studies reporting a 'hungry bone syndrome' in patients who had a parathyroidectomy for PHPT, to identify patients at risk and address the pitfalls in their management. The severe hypocalcaemia is believed to be due to increased influx of calcium into bone, due to the sudden removal of the effect of high circulating levels of PTH on osteoclastic resorption, leading to a decrease in the activation frequency of new remodelling sites and to a decrease in remodelling space, although there is no good documentation for this. Various risk factors have been suggested for the development of HBS, including older age, weight/volume of the resected parathyroid glands, radiological evidence of bone disease and vitamin D deficiency.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed sonographic findings and pathologic results of thyroid nodules with macrocalcification in patients who underwent US-guided FNA in our hospital from January 2009 through December 2010. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) malignant or benign nodules confirmed on histologic examination of surgical specimens after US-guided FNA and (b) nodules not histologically confirmed that were subjected to FNA at least twice and follow-up US examinations for 2 years. Thyroid nodules with macrocalcification were classified into 4 groups: smooth total (eggshell) calcification, smooth partial calcification, irregular calcification, and nodular calcification. Diagnostic yield of FNA for thyroid nodules with macrocalcification was determined by cytology. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of preoperative FNA cytology were calculated and compared with those of histologic examination of surgical specimens. Results: There were 188 nodules with macrocalcification in 167 patients; of these, 95 were benign, 80 were malignant, and 13 were nondiagnostic. Diagnostic yield of FNA for thyroid nodules with macrocalcification was 93.08%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.51%, 90.91%, 95.65%, and 96.77%, respectively.

In this study we have been investigated, by immunohistochemisty and quantitative Real Time PCR, the HOX B13 expression in bladder cancer evolution and progression, evaluating its ability to discriminate between NMIBC and MBCI phenotypes. Cytoplasmic HOX B13 delocalization significantly relates with muscle invasion (p 0.004). In addition in the series of NMIBC nuclear HOX B13 expression loss is significantly associated to shorter disease free survival (p-value=0.038) defining a potential prognostic role. Overexpression of HOX B13 in more aggressive phenotype is also demonstrate at gene level by quantitative RT-PCR. The de-regulation and delocalization of HOX B13 in urinary bladder cancer supports again the important role of HOX genes in tumor evolution and represents a starting point to establish an integrated analysis, in which HOX genes represent important prognostic and predictive markers for bladder cancer.", "anno": [[73, 74, true], [143, 144, true], [419, 420, true], [645, 646, true], [837, 838, true], [969, 970, true], [1078, 1079, true], [1316, 1317, true], [1405, 1406, true], [1587, 1588, true], [1700, 1701, true], [2002, 2003, true]]}, {"id": 23337386, "text": "Progress made through technological advances in drug discovery can be undermined by problems with measurement equipment, but it is often difficult to detect the issues without a specific investigation.

They are immersed in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution, and the SDS molecules selectively adsorb onto m-SWNTs.

Electron transmission spectroscopy (ETS) and dissociative electron attachment spectroscopy (DEAS), in the 0-6 eV and 0-15 eV energy range, respectively, were applied with the aim of modeling the behavior of these pesticide molecules under reductive conditions in vivo. Formation of long-lived parent molecular anions and fragment negative ions was observed at incident electron energies very close to zero, in agreement with the results of density functional theory calculations. The gas-phase DEA process, analogous to dissociative electron transfer in solution, was considered as a model for the initial step which occurs in the intermembrane space of mitochondria when a xenobiotic molecule captures an electron \"leaked\" from the respiratory chain. A possible involvement of the fragments produced by DEA to the pesticides under investigation into cellular processes is discussed.

Pericytes, essential for the viability of the microvasculature, are especially susceptible to oxidative stress. Mitochondrial carbonic anhydrases, regulators of the oxidative metabolism of glucose, determine the rate of reactive oxygen species production and inhibition of mitochondrial carbonic anhydrases rescues glucose-induced pericyte loss in the diabetic mouse brain. We hypothesized that high glucose induces intracellular oxidative stress and pericyte apoptosis and that inhibition of mitochondrial carbonic anhydrases protects pericytes from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. To validate our hypothesis, conditionally immortalized cerebral pericyte (IPC) cultures were established from Immortomice to investigate the effect of high glucose on oxidative stress and pericyte apoptosis. The IPCs expressed pericyte markers and induced high transendothelial electrical resistance and low permeability in brain endothelial cell monolayers comparable with pericytes in primary cultures. The IPCs also secreted cytokines constitutively and in response to lipopolysaccharide similar to pericytes. High glucose caused oxidative stress and apoptosis of these cells, with both oxidative stress and apoptosis significantly reduced after mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase inhibition. These results provide the first evidence that pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial carbonic anhydrases attenuates pericyte apoptosis caused by high glucose-induced oxidative stress. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have a long history of safe clinical use and can be immediately evaluated for this new indication in translational research. Thus, mitochondrial carbonic anhydrases may provide a new therapeutic target for oxidative stress-related illnesses of the brain.", "anno": [[228, 229, true], [340, 341, true], [602, 603, true], [815, 816, true], [1023, 1024, true], [1220, 1221, true], [1328, 1329, true], [1509, 1510, true], [1698, 1699, true], [1853, 1854, true], [1983, 1984, true]]}, {"id": 23404092, "text": "The impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the natural history of HIV-1 infection has resulted in dramatic reductions in disease-associated morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the epidemiology of HIV-1 infection worldwide is changing, as women now represent a substantial proportion of infected adults. As more highly effective and tolerable antiretroviral regimens become available, and as the prevention of mother-to-child transmission becomes an attainable goal in the management of HIV-infected individuals, more and more HIV-positive women are choosing to become pregnant and have children. Consequently, it is important to consider the efficacy and safety of antiretroviral agents in pregnancy. Protease inhibitors are a common class of medication used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection and are increasingly being used in pregnancy. However, several studies have raised concerns regarding pharmacokinetic alterations in pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, which results in suboptimal drug concentrations and a theoretically higher risk of virologic failure and perinatal transmission. Drug level reductions have been observed with each individual protease inhibitor and dose adjustments in pregnancy are suggested for certain agents. Furthermore, studies have also raised concerns regarding the safety of protease inhibitors in pregnancy, particularly as they may increase the risk of pre-term birth and metabolic disturbances. Overall, protease inhibitors are safe and effective for the treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women. Specifically, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir- and atazanavir-based regimens are preferred in pregnancy, while ritonavir-boosted darunavir- and saquinavir-based therapies are reasonable alternatives. This paper reviews the use of protease inhibitors in pregnancy, focusing on pharmacokinetic and safety considerations, and outlines the recommendations for use of this class of medication in the HIV-1-infected pregnant woman.", "anno": [[166, 167, true], [307, 308, true], [600, 601, true], [705, 706, true], [845, 846, true], [1109, 1110, true], [1258, 1259, true], [1452, 1453, true], [1554, 1555, true], [1750, 1751, true], [1976, 1977, true]]}]}
