They are utilized in order to overcome the major challenges being associated with this route of administration - namely poor solubility (I), poor permeability (II) and poor GI-stability (III). In order to improve drug solubility nanonization of the API, the use of solid lipid nanoparticles and porous adsorbent particles have shown great potential. Nanocrystals and selfnanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) resulted already in numerous marketed drug products. Moreover, proof-of-principle studies for nanocarrier systems providing enhanced oral drug uptake are available. By providing a comparatively more intimate contact with the absorption membrane, a prolonged GI-residence time and/or exhibiting permeation enhancing properties, oral absorption can be strongly improved. Likely because of safety considerations and because of insufficiently high bioavailability improvements (<5-fold), however, a commercial interest in these systems is limited. Poor GI-stability can be overcome by incorporating the drug in nanocarrier systems providing a protective effect towards an enzymatic attack in the GI-tract. Furthermore, as nanocarrier systems can at least to some extent diffuse into the mucus gel layer releasing their payload there, a presystemic metabolism of the drug on the way between the delivery system and the absorption membrane can be excluded. Future trends are mainly focusing on carrier systems capable of not just improving solubility but providing also controlled drug release as well as on nanocarrier systems capable of efficiently permeating the mucus gel layer without destroying it.", "anno": [[103, 104, true], [296, 297, true], [453, 454, true], [574, 575, true], [686, 687, true], [890, 891, true], [1065, 1066, true], [1223, 1224, true], [1472, 1473, true], [1720, 1721, true]]}, {"id": 23508744, "text": "Two new tirucallane triterpenoids, aquilacallanes A-B (1-2), together with 15 known compounds (3-17) were isolated from the leaves of Aquilaria sinensis.

Furthermore, it was found that atRA could enhance cell adhesion, but had no effect on the cell cycle and apoptosis. Using an Illumina Human HT-12 v4 expression microarray, 207 upregulated and 173 downregulated genes were identified in HepG2 cells treated with atRA.

Using Gene Ontology analysis, the greatest significance was found in extracellular-matrix-related molecular functions and the cellular component in upregulated genes. The upregulation of collagen 8A2 (COL8A2) was further confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Knockdown of COL8A2 blocked enhancement in the early stage of cell adhesion by atRA treatment. Re-expression of COL8A2 in COL8A2-knocked-down HCC cells reversed the effect of small interfering RNA-COL8A2. In addition, COL8A2 could increase HCC cell migration and invasion.

This study aimed at investigating arsenic-mediated intracellular redox status and signaling cascades leading to COX-2 induction in human uroepithelial cells (SV-HUC-1). SV-HUC-1 cells were exposed to sodium arsenite and COX-2 expression, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, glutathione (GSH) levels, ROS induction and Nrf2 expression were quantified.

CroFab has been clinically demonstrated to be most effective when administered within 6\u00a0h of snake envenomation, and improved clinical outcomes are correlated with quicker timing of administration. An alternate reconstitution method was devised, using 18\u00a0mL 0.9% saline with manual inversion, with the goal of shortening reconstitution time while maintaining a high quality, efficacious product. METHODS: An analytical study was designed to compare the physicochemical properties of 3 separate batches of CroFab when reconstituted using the standard procedure (10\u00a0mL WFI with gentle swirling) and a modified rapid procedure using 18\u00a0mL 0.9% saline and manual inversion. The physical and chemical characteristics of the same 3 batches were assessed using various analytic methodologies associated with routine quality control release testing.

Consequences of iodine deficiency include goiter, intellectual impairments, growth retardation, neonatal hypothyroidism, and increased pregnancy loss and infant mortality. Summary: In 1990, the United Nations World Summit for Children established the goal of eliminating iodine deficiency worldwide. Considerable progress has since been achieved, largely through programs of universal salt iodization. Approximately 70% of all households worldwide currently have access to adequately iodized salt. In 2013, as defined by a national or subnational median urinary iodine concentration of 100-299\u2009\u03bcg/L in school-aged children, 111 countries have sufficient iodine intake. Thirty countries remain iodine-deficient; 9 are moderately deficient, 21 are mildly deficient, and none are currently considered severely iodine-deficient. Ten countries have excessive iodine intake. In North America, both the United States and Canada are generally iodine-sufficient, although recent data suggest pregnant U.S. women are mildly iodine-deficient. Emerging issues include discrepancies between urinary iodine status in pregnant women compared to school-aged children in some populations, the problem of re-emerging iodine deficiency in parts of the developed world, the importance of food industry use of iodized salt, regions of iodine excess, and the potential effects of initiatives to lower population sodium consumption on iodine intake. Conclusions: Although substantial progress has been made over the last several decades, iodine deficiency remains a significant health problem worldwide and affects both industrialized and developing nations. The ongoing monitoring of population iodine status remains crucially important, and particular attention may need to be paid to monitoring the status of vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women and infants. There is also need for ongoing monitoring of iodized salt and other dietary iodine sources in order to prevent excess as well as insufficient iodine nutrition. Finally, it will be essential to coordinate interventions designed to reduce population sodium intake with salt iodization programs in order to maintain adequate levels of iodine nutrition as salt intake declines.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [83, 84, true], [255, 256, true], [264, 265, true], [383, 384, true], [485, 486, true], [581, 582, true], [752, 753, true], [908, 909, true], [952, 953, true], [1115, 1116, true], [1510, 1511, true], [1719, 1720, true], [1932, 1933, true], [2092, 2093, true], [2306, 2307, true]]}, {"id": 23571068, "text": "The knowledge of DNA repair in a target species is of first importance as it is the primary line of defense against genotoxicants, and a better knowledge of DNA repair capacity in fish could help to interpret genotoxicity data and/or assist in the choice of target species, developmental stage and tissues to focus on, both for environmental biomonitoring studies and DNA repair testing. This review focuses in a first part on what is presently known on a mechanistic basis, about the various DNA repair systems in fish, in vivo and in established cell lines. Data on base excision repair (BER), direct reversal with O(6)-alkylguanine transferase and double strand breaks repair, although rather scarce, are being reviewed, as well as nucleotide excision repair (NER) and photoreactivation repair (PER), which are by far the most studied repair mechanisms in fish. Most of these repair mechanisms seem to be strongly species and tissue dependent; they also depend on the developmental stage of the organisms. BER is efficient in vivo, although no data has been found on in vitro models. NER activity is quite low or even inexistent depending on the studies; however this lack is partly compensated by a strong PER activity, especially in early developmental stage. In a second part, a survey of the ecotoxicological studies integrating DNA repair as a parameter responding to single or mixture of contaminant is realized. Three main approaches are being used: the measurement of DNA repair gene expression after exposure, although it has not yet been clearly established whether gene expression is indicative of repair capacity; the monitoring of DNA damage removal by following DNA repair kinetics; and the modulation of DNA repair activity following exposure in situ, in order to assess the impact of exposure history on DNA repair capacity. Since all DNA repair processes are possible targets for environmental pollutants, we can also wonder at which extent such a modulation of repair capacities in fish could be the base for the development of new biomarkers of genotoxicity. Knowing the importance of the germ cell DNA integrity in the reproductive success of aquatic organisms, the DNA repair capacity of such cells deserve to be more studied, as well as DNA repair capacities of established fish cell lines. The limited amount of available data, which shows low/slow DNA repair capacities of fish cell lines compared with mammalian cell lines, concerned mainly the NER system; thus this point merits to be explored more deeply.

Therefore, we investigated the effects of EQ on androgen- and estrogen-regulated gene expressions in the pituitary and circulating luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) levels in adult male rats. 3-Month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=12 per group) were treated by gavage for 5 days with either EQ (100 and 250 mg/kg BW/day) or vehicle olive oil (1 ml/rat/day).

Levels of pituitary hormones and gene expression were measured by radioimmunoassays and quantitative TaqMan(\u00ae) real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The present findings revealed that the pituitary mechanisms involved in the effects of EQ and FLUT were different due to the opposite changes in the mRNA expression levels of estrogen receptor subtype alpha (ER\u03b1)-, truncated estrogen receptor product-1 (TERP-1)- and -2 (TERP-2)-, gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GnRH receptor)-, beta-subunit of LH (LH\u03b2)-, and gonadotropin alpha subunit (\u03b1-subunit) genes. EQ displayed typical ER-agonistic actions as shown by the significant increases in ER\u03b1-, TERP-1/-2 mRNA expressions and serum PRL levels along with the significant reduction in serum LH levels, whereas FLUT exerted opposite effects on gonadotropin secretion and expression. Taken together, our findings are the first in vivo data that upon sub-acute oral exposure of EQ show an estrogenic effect on reproductive endocrine activity of the pituitary in adult male rats.

We have focussed on the observation that AChE, operating as a trophic agent independent of its enzymatic action, does indeed trigger calcium entry into neurons. It is possible that AChE has a dual non-classical action that ranges along a trophic-toxic axis, depending on amount, duration of availability and, most significantly, age. The neurodegenerative diseases could therefore be viewed as aberrant activation of developmental mechanisms with 'non-cholinergic' AChE as a, perhaps the, pivotal molecule. We have identified two peptides that could be cleaved from the C-terminus of T-AChE, one (T14), within the other (T30), and which have a strong sequence homology to the comparable region of beta-amyloid whilst the inert residue within the T30 sequence ('T15') acts as a control, and is without effect. We have subsequently been able to ascribe the trophic-toxic actions of the both T14 and T30 peptides to the modulation of calcium influx via an allosteric site on the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17-nAChR). If the scenario described here is indeed the primary mechanism of neurodegeneration, then interception of the actions of the 'non-cholinergic' AChE-peptides T14 and T30 at the \u03b17-nAChR, would be a promising novel therapy for arresting and stabilising cell loss in Alzheimer's disease, whereas detection of the peptides ideally in the blood, could provide a sensitive surrogate marker. If the marker was sensitive enough to be detected pre-symptomatically in a routine blood test, then the medication for arresting further cell loss could be initiated at that time, and the symptoms would never appear.

Cardiomyoblast cells pretreated with Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780), an estrogen receptor antagonist was applied to investigate the estrogenic activity of Danshen. The Danshen extract preventive effects on Leu27IGF-II-induced IGF-IIR signaling activator and H9c2 cell apoptosis were identified using TUNEL assay, JC-1 staining and Western blot assay. We found that Danshen extract treatments significantly enhanced phosphorylated Akt through estrogen receptor activation to inhibit Leu27IGF-II-induced calcineurin activation and block H9c2 cell apoptosis. Danshen extracts suppressed the IGF-IIR signaling proteins, pro-apoptotic proteins and reversed the mitochondrial membrane instability induced by Leu27IGF-II. However, the cardioprotective properties of Danshen to inhibit Leu27IGF-II-induced cell apoptosis and promote cell survival were attenuated by applying ICI, which suggests that the Danshen cardioprotective effect is mediated through estrogen receptors.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: Identifying the main active compounds of Caesalpinia sappan L. extracts inhibiting the IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells by partial least squares (PLS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four samples with different proportions of compounds were prepared from Caesalpinia sappan L. by supercritical CO2 fluid extraction (SCFE) and refluxing. Each of 64 samples was applied to RAW 264.7 cells with LPS to evaluate whether IL-6 production by LPS is affected by addition of each sample. The IL-6 production in medium was determined by ELISA and the inhibitory activity of each sample was analyzed. In addition, the fingerprints of these 64 samples were also established by ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). We used the PLS, a simplified method, to evaluate the results from IL-6 production and fingerprints. RESULTS: Each of 64 samples markedly suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 production in RAW cells. The fingerprints by UPLC-MS clearly revealed variations among 64 samples produced in different extract conditions. The PLS analysis with IL-6 production and fingerprints by UPLC-MS suggested that the peaks 71, 93, 150, 157, 168 have more influence on the inhibitory activity of Caesalpinia sappan L. extracts.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that carnosine interacts transiently with monomeric A\u03b242 by salt bridges with charged side chains, and van der Waals contacts with residues in and around the central hydrophobic cluster ((17)LVFFA(21)). NMR experiments on the nonaggregative fragment A\u03b212-28 did not evidence specific intermolecular interactions between the peptide and carnosine, in agreement with MD simulations.

However, hemopressin appears to have its effect on appetite by affecting satiety rather than reward, suggesting an alternative mode of action which might avoid adverse side effects. Here, to resolve the neuronal circuitry mediating hemopressin's actions, we have combined blood-oxygen-level-dependent, pharmacological-challenge magnetic resonance imaging with c-Fos functional activity mapping to compare brain regions responsive to systemic administration of hemopressin and the synthetic CB1 inverse agonist, AM251. Using these complementary methods, we demonstrate that hemopressin activates distinct neuronal substrates within the brain, focused mainly on the feeding-related circuits of the mediobasal hypothalamus and in nociceptive regions of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and dorsal raphe (DR). In contrast to AM251, there is a distinct lack of activation of the brain reward centres, such as the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex, which normally form a functional activity signature for the central action of synthetic CB1 receptor inverse agonists. Thus, hemopressin modulates the function of key feeding-related brain nuclei of the mediobasal hypothalamus, and descending pain pathways of the PAG and DR, and not higher limbic structures.
