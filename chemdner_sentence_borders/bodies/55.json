AID initiates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (CSR) by deaminating cytosine to uracil in specific immunoglobulin (Ig) gene regions. However, other loci, including cancer-related genes, are also targeted. Thus, tight regulation of AID is crucial to balance immunity versus disease such as cancer. AID is regulated by several mechanisms including nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Here we have studied nuclear import kinetics and subnuclear trafficking of AID in live cells and characterized in detail its nuclear localization signal. Importantly, we find that the nuclear localization signal motif also directs AID to nucleoli where it colocalizes with its interaction partner, catenin-\u03b2-like 1 (CTNNBL1), and physically associates with nucleolin and nucleophosmin. Moreover, we demonstrate that release of AID from nucleoli is dependent on its C-terminal motif. Finally, we find that CSR efficiency correlates strongly with the arithmetic product of AID nuclear import rate and DNA deamination activity. Our findings suggest that directional nucleolar transit is important for the physiological function of AID and demonstrate that nuclear/nucleolar import and DNA cytosine deamination together define the biological activity of AID.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aims to prove the anti-diarrhoeal activity of aqueous extract of leaves of Ocimum kilimandscharicum in animal models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aqueous extract was tested at three different dose levels (100, 200 and 400mg/kg, p.o. in rats and the corresponding doses in mice) against castor-oil induced diarrhoea model and castor oil induced enteropooling assay in rats; and charcoal meal test/intestinal motility test in mice. The parameters observed were the onset of defecation, cumulative faecal weight and consistency of faeces in the castor oil induced diarrhoea model; the weight of intestinal content in castor oil induced enteropooling assay; and the distance travelled by charcoal in the intestinal motility test. RESULTS: A significant delay in the onset of defecation (p<0.05), reduction in the cumulative faecal weight (p<0.001), along with a change in the faecal consistency from watery to solid form was observed at the dose of 200mg/kg in the castor oil-induced diarrhoea model.

Major unanswered questions include what pathogenic mechanisms, such as bacterial infections, may drive the accumulation of inflammatory infiltrates in the human prostate, and how inflammation might contribute to disease. To study this potential link in an in vivo system, we developed a mouse model of long-term bacteria-induced chronic inflammation of the prostate using a human prostatectomy-derived strain of Propionibacterium acnes. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were inoculated, via urethral catheterization, with vehicle control or a prostatectomy-derived strain of P. acnes (PA2). Animals were assessed at 2 days, 1, 2, or 8 weeks post-inoculation via histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: PA2 inoculation resulted in severe acute and chronic inflammation confined to the dorsal lobe of the prostate. Chronic inflammation persisted for at least 8 weeks post-inoculation. Inflammatory lesions were associated with an increase in the Ki-67 proliferative index, and diminished Nkx3.1 and androgen receptor (AR) production. Interestingly, the observed response required live bacteria and both IHC and in situ hybridization assays for P. acnes indicated a potential intracellular presence of P. acnes in prostate epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first mouse model of long-term prostatic inflammation induced by P. acnes, and more generally, any prostatectomy-derived bacterial isolate. This model may serve as a valuable preclinical model of chronic prostatic inflammation that can be used to mechanistically study the link between inflammation and prostatic disease.

We assessed nociception, endocannabinoids and the therapeutic efficacy of R-flurbiprofen in young and aged mice in the spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain. R-flurbiprofen was used because it is able to reduce neuropathic pain in young mice in part by increasing anandamide. Aged mice developed stronger nociceptive hypersensitivity after sciatic nerve injury than young mice. This was associated with low anandamide levels in the dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, thalamus and cortex, which further decreased after nerve injury. In aged mice, R-flurbiprofen had only weak antinociceptive efficacy and it failed to restore normal anandamide levels after nerve injury. In terms of the mechanisms, we found that fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) which degrades anandamide, was upregulated after nerve injury at both ages, so that this upregulation likely did not account for the age-dependent differences. However, enzymes contributing to oxidative metabolism of anandamide, namely cyclooxygenase-1 and Cyp2D6, were increased in the brain of aged mice, possibly enhancing the oxidative breakdown of anandamide.

Quantitative structure-activity relationship studies were performed using genetic algorithm coupled partial least square and stepwise multiple linear regression methods to elucidate the important structural properties responsible for the observed inhibitory effects. To further understand the mode of interaction between these flavonoids and AO, a homology model of the enzyme was built and flavonoids were docked into its active site. The most important amino acids involved in the interactions were identified. 3. Quercetin, myricetin and genistein were the most potent inhibitors establishing favorable interactions with the enzyme.

Silver (Ag) ions certainly play a crucial role, and the form of nanoparticles can change the dissolution rate, bioavailability, biodistribution, and cellular uptake of Ag. However, whether nAg exerts direct \"particle-specific\" effects has been under debate. Here we demonstrated that nAg exhibited a robust inhibition on RNA polymerase activity and overall RNA transcription through direct Ag binding to RNA polymerase, which is separated from the cytotoxicity pathway induced by Ag ions. nAg treatment in vitro resulted in reduced hemoglobin concentration in erythroid cells; in vivo administration of nAg in mice caused profound reduction of hemoglobin content in embryonic erythrocytes, associated with anemia in the embryos. Embryonic anemia and general proliferation deficit due to the significant inhibition on RNA synthesis, at least partially, accounted for embryonic developmental retardation upon nAg administration. To date, there is no conclusive answer to the sources of nAg-mediated toxicity: Ag ions or \"particle-specific\" effects, or both. We here demonstrated that both Ag ions and nAg particles simultaneously existed inside cells, demonstrating the \"Trojan horse\" effects of nAg particles in posing biological impacts on erythroid cells. Moreover, our results suggested that \"particle-specific\" effects could be the predominant mediator in eliciting biological influences on erythroid cells under relatively low concentrations of nAg exposure.

In many cell types, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF\u03baB) and TGF\u03b2 coordinately regulate cell survival to maintain tissue homeostasis. Because GCT cell lines exhibit constitutively activated NF\u03baB, we hypothesized that NF\u03baB blocks TGF\u03b2-mediated cell death in GCT cells. To test this hypothesis, we used the human GCT cell line KGN, which exhibits loss of betaglycan, a TGF\u03b2 co-receptor. After inhibition of NF\u03baB in KGN cells, re-expression of betaglycan resulted in a decrease in cell viability, which was further decreased by TGF\u03b22. Intriguingly, TGF\u03b22 increased NF\u03baB reporter activity in control cells, but betaglycan expression suppressed both basal and TGF\u03b22-stimulated NF\u03baB activity. Chemical inhibition of Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 (SMAD2/3) signaling or SMAD2/3 gene silencing revealed that both SMADs contributed to cell survival. Furthermore, inhibiting NF\u03baB activity resulted in a specific reduction in SMAD3 expression. Conversely, overexpression of SMAD3 increased basal NF\u03baB activity and countered betaglycan-mediated suppression of NF\u03baB activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Organic and aqueous extracts (132) were prepared from 47 plant species and screened for antimicrobial properties against dermatologically relevant pathogens using the micro-titre plate dilution method. Four different plant combinations were investigated for interactive properties and the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentration (\u01a9FIC) calculated.

In the present study, a reactive oxygen species-responsive nanocarrier has been successfully self-assembled from an amphiphilic hyperbranched polymer consisting of alternative hydrophobic selenide groups and hydrophilic phosphate segments in the dendritic backbone. Because the hydrophobic selenide groups transformed into the hydrophilic selenone groups after oxidation under the exclusive oxidative microenvironment within cancer cells, the amphiphilic hyperbranched precursors become hydrophilic ones. As a result, the nanocarriers were rapidly disassembled in target cells, resulting in fast intracellular drug release. The hydrophilic products of oxidation can be degraded into harmless small molecular species via the enzymatic digestion of the phosphate segments and then eliminated by renal excretion. Meanwhile, the reactive selenium-containing nanocarrier possesses a potent intrinsic anticancer effect since selenium compounds can produce antitumor metabolites which induce apoptosis of cancer cells efficiently.

Taking this into account, and the fact that ion channels are frequent targets for natural toxins, we examined the effect of Cramb816 and three compounds from the crambescin family, norcrambescin A2 (NcrambA2), crambescin A2 (CrambA2), and crambescin C1 (CrambC1), in the main voltage-dependent ion channels in neurons: sodium, potassium, and calcium channels. Electrophysiological recordings of voltage gated sodium, potassium, and calcium currents, in the presence of these guanidine alkaloids, were performed in cortical neurons from embryonic mice. Different effects were discovered: crambescins inhibited K(+) currents with the following potency: NcrambA2 > CrambC1 > CrambA2, while Cramb816 lacked an effect. Only CrambC1 and Cramb816 partially blocked Na(+) total current. However, Cramb816 partially blocked Ca(2+) , while NcrambA2 did not. Since the blocking effect of Cramb816 on calcium currents has not been previously reported in detail, we further pharmacologically isolated the two main fractions of HVA Ca(2+) channels in neurons and investigated the Cramb816 effect on them.

These two families of guanidine alkaloids clearly showed a structure-activity relationship with the crambescins acting on voltage-gated potassium channels, while Cramb816 blocks the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1 with higher potency than nifedipine. The novel evidence that Cramb816 partially blocked Ca(V) and Na(V) channels in neurons suggests that this compound might be involved in decreasing the neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission in the central nervous system.

Acrolein instillation significantly increased the muscle contractions of rat bladder detrusor after 1 and 6 h but markedly decreased detrusor contractions after 24 h.

The iNOS inhibitors significantly inhibited the acrolein-increased nitrite/nitrate levels, but not IL-6 levels. IL-6-neutralizing antibodies effectively inhibited the acrolein-increased NOx levels.

METHODS: Ethanol-na\u00efve male Long Evans rats were given opioid receptor antagonists either intravenously, subcutaneously, or intracranially into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), followed by intravenous administration of ethanol or morphine. We measured extracellular dopamine in vivo using microdialysis probes inserted into the nucleus accumbens shell (n\u2009=\u2009114). RESULTS: Administration of naltrexone (intravenously) and \u03b2-funaltrexamine (subcutaneously), as well as intracranial injection of naltrexone into the VTA did not prevent the initiation of dopamine release by intravenous ethanol administration, but prevented it from being as prolonged. In contrast, morphine-stimulated mesolimbic dopamine release was effectively suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide novel evidence that there are two distinct mechanisms that mediate ethanol-stimulated mesolimbic dopamine release (an initial phase and a delayed phase), and that opioid receptor activation is required to maintain the delayed-phase dopamine release. Moreover, \u03bc-opioid receptors account for this delayed-phase dopamine response, and the VTA is potentially the site of action of this mechanism.

Secondary brain sites that were defined to mediate amylin action - and hence potential additional sites of interaction with other hormones - include the nucleus of the solitary tract, the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the lateral hypothalamic area and other hypothalamic nuclei. The focus of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of amylin interactions in the control of eating.

FOXO1, a key downstream effector of PTEN, inhibits androgen-independent activation of the AR. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. METHODS: The inhibitory effect of FOXO1 on full-length and constitutively active splice variants of the AR was examined by luciferase reporter assays and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In vitro protein binding assays and western blot analyses were used to determine the regions in FOXO1 and AR responsible for their interaction. RESULTS: We found that a putative transcription repression domain in the NH2-terminus of FOXO1 is dispensable for FOXO1 inhibition of the AR. In vitro protein binding assays showed that FOXO1 binds to the transcription activation unit 5 (TAU5) motif in the AR NH2-terminal domain (NTD), a region required for recruitment of p160 activators including SRC-1. Ectopic expression of SRC-1 augmented transcriptional activity of some, but not all AR splice variants examined. Forced expression of FOXO1 blocked the effect of SRC-1 on AR variants' transcriptional activity by decreasing the binding of SRC-1 to the AR NTD. Ectopic expression of FOXO1 inhibited expression of endogenous genes activated primarily by alternatively spliced AR variants in human castration-resistant PCa 22Rv1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: FOXO1 binds to the TAU5 motif in the AR NTD and inhibits ligand-independent activation of AR splice variants, suggesting the PTEN/FOXO1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for inhibition of aberrant AR activation and castration-resistant PCa growth.

Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR data indicate that, prior to the onset of puberty, expression of both Lin28b and Lin28a decreases in the ovary, while expression of only Lin28a decreases in the hypothalamus; the expression of Lin28a increases after the onset of puberty in the pituitary.

Internal and external validity was tested by comparing complete remission (CR) rates and survival outcomes of the model with original data, other clinical trials and a population-based study. RESULTS: No significant differences in patient and treatment characteristics, CR rate, 5-year overall and disease-free survival were found between the simulated and original data. External validation showed no significant differences in survival between simulated data and other clinical trials. However, differences existed between the simulated data and a population-based study. CONCLUSIONS: The model developed in this study is proved to be valid for analysis of an AML population participating in a clinical trial. The generalizability of the model to a broader patient population has not been proven yet. Further research is needed to identify differences between the clinical trial population and other AML patients and to incorporate these differences in the model.", "anno": [[10, 11, true], [97, 98, true], [248, 249, true], [309, 310, true], [320, 321, true], [444, 445, true], [453, 454, true], [566, 567, true], [624, 625, true], [698, 699, true], [890, 891, true], [899, 900, true], [1070, 1071, true], [1186, 1187, true], [1272, 1273, true], [1285, 1286, true], [1410, 1411, true], [1501, 1502, true], [1664, 1665, true]]}, {"id": 23131595, "text": "Currently there are no pharmacological therapies licensed to treat sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI). Considering the high incidence and mortality of sepsis-associated AKI, there is an urgent medical need to develop effective pharmacological interventions. Two phase II clinical trials recently demonstrated beneficial effects of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP). In critically ill patients with sepsis-associated AKI, treatment with AP reduced the urinary excretion of tubular injury biomarkers and plasma markers of inflammation, which was associated with improvement of renal function. The dephosphorylating enzyme, AP, is endogenously present in the renal proximal tubule apical membrane but becomes depleted during ischemia-induced AKI, thereby possibly contributing to further renal damage. The exact mechanism of action of AP in AKI is unknown, but might be related to detoxification of circulating lipopolysaccharide and other proinflammatory mediators that lose their proinflammatory effects after dephosphorylation. Alternatively, tissue damage associated with systemic inflammation might be attenuated by an AP-mediated effect on adenosine metabolism. Adenosine is a signaling molecule that has been shown to protect the body from inflammation-induced tissue injury, which is derived through dephosphorylation of ATP. In this Perspectives article, we discuss the clinical activity of AP and its putative molecular modes of action, and we speculate on its use to treat and possibly prevent sepsis-associated AKI.", "anno": [[110, 111, true], [265, 266, true], [376, 377, true], [601, 602, true], [809, 810, true], [1038, 1039, true], [1175, 1176, true], [1341, 1342, true], [1535, 1536, true]]}, {"id": 23464739, "text": "Uncinataflavone (1), a new flavonoid, together with four known compounds (2-5), was isolated from Selaginella uncinata (Desv.)

The presence of several tentatively identified volatile flavour compounds (VOCs), both during the enzymatic treatment and the lactic acid fermentation of the milk base, were monitored using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). The formation of the major flavour compounds (acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin, and 2-butanone) followed a sigmoidal trend described by the modified Gompertz model. The HHP treatment of milk increased significantly the volatile compound formation rate whereas it did not affect the duration of the lag phase of formation, with the exception of acetaldehyde and diacetyl formation. On the contrary, the TGase cross-linking of milk did not significantly modify the formation rate of the volatile compounds but shortened the duration of the lag phase of their formation.", "anno": [[237, 238, true], [501, 502, true], [665, 666, true], [881, 882, true], [1068, 1069, true]]}, {"id": 23122065, "text": "The inhibitory effect of an aqueous extract from spinach on degranulation of RBL-2H3 cells is herein reported. The extract significantly suppressed antigen-induced degranulation in a dose-dependent manner without affecting cell viability. Active substances in the extract were heat-stable and trypsin-resistant with molecular weights ranging from 500 Da to 14 kDa. The extract inhibited elevation of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration caused by stimulation by antigen, while not suppressing degranulation induced by a calcium ionophore A23187. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the inhibitory effect results from downregulation of phosphorylation of both Syk kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the signalling pathways involved in degranulation caused by the antigen-antibody interaction. Taken together, these findings suggest that aqueous spinach extract has an anti-allergic activity that controls degranulation.", "anno": [[109, 110, true], [237, 238, true], [363, 364, true], [546, 547, true], [799, 800, true], [926, 927, true]]}, {"id": 23584895, "text": "Self-assembled nanodiamond-lipid hybrid particles (NDLPs) harness the potent interaction between the nanodiamond (ND)-surface and small molecules, while providing a mechanism for cell-targeted imaging and therapy of triple negative breast cancers.
