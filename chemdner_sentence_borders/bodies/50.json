Derivatives of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal immunomodulatory structure of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan, have gained considerable attention in the past decades, because of their potent adjuvant effects. Murabutide is a safe derivative of MDP, which interacts with cells of the immune system, both innate and adaptive, and exerts its effect through activation of Nod2. The transcriptional response of murabutide-stimulated macrophages revealed enhanced expression of genes coding for various proteins such as immune mediators and their receptors, transcription factors and kinases, ion channels/transporters and proteins involved in cell metabolic activity, thus reflecting a broad spectrum of biological effects. In addition to its well recognized adjuvant effect, murabutide has also been shown to enhance the host's resistance against microbial infections, nonspecific resistance against tumors and the induction of cytokines and chemokines implicated in enhancing the immune response and hematopoesis. This article provides an insight into the mechanism of action of murabutide and its interactions with the cells of the immune system in vitro and in vivo. On account of its numerous biological effects, murabutide has been the subject of several clinical studies. Many of these have confirmed its potential to synergize with cytokines of therapeutic interest in potentiating the tumoricidal activity of macrophages or targeting chronic viral diseases, as well as reducing the cytokine dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements have shown that fullerene flowers have a hexagonal structure with cell dimensions of a = 2.539 nm and c = 1.021 nm, which differ from that of pristine C(60). Mixtures of flower-shaped C(60) crystals and free-standing C(60) nanotubes are found in the 0.1% C(12)G(2)/butanol system. However, clusters or giant aggregates of nanowhiskers lacking any specific shape are observed in the 1% C(12)G(2)/butanol system although these crystals exhibit hexagonal close-packed structures. Flower-shaped C(60) microcrystals are also observed with anionic surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC). C(60) flowers obtained from 0.01% CTAB and 0.01% CTAC also exhibit hexagonal structures with cell dimensions of a = 2.329 nm and c = 1.273 nm, a = 2.459 nm and c = 0.938 nm, respectively.

Considerable attention is focused on defining the neurobiological mechanisms of the extinction of conditioned fear memory in an effort to identify mechanisms that may hold clinical significance for remediating aberrant fear memory. Serotonin modulates the acquisition and retention of conditioned emotional memory, and the serotonin 2A receptor (5HT2AR) may be one of the postsynaptic targets mediating such effects. Here we tested the hypothesis that the 5HT2AR regulates the consolidation and extinction of fear memory in male C57BL/6J mice. The influence of 5HT2ARs on memory consolidation was further confirmed with a novel object recognition task. With a trace fear conditioning paradigm, administration of the 5HT2AR agonist TCB-2 (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) before the extinction test facilitated the acquisition of extinction of fear memory as compared to vehicle treatment. In contrast, administration of the 5HT2AR antagonist MDL 11,939 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) delayed the acquisition of extinction of fear memory. Further, the post-conditioning administration of TCB-2 enhanced contextual and cued fear memory, possibly by facilitating the consolidation of fear memory. Administration of TCB-2 also facilitated the acquisition of extinction of fear memory in delay fear conditioned mice. Stimulation or blockade of 5HT2ARs did not affect the encoding or retrieval of conditioned fear memory. Finally, administration of TCB-2 right after training in an object recognition task enhanced the consolidation of object memory. These results suggest that stimulation of 5HT2ARs facilitates the consolidation and extinction of trace and delay cued fear memory and the consolidation of object memory. Blocking the 5HT2AR impairs the acquisition of fear memory extinction. The results support the view that serotonergic activation of the 5HT2AR provides an important modulatory influence on circuits engaged during extinction learning. Taken together these results suggest that the 5HT2AR may be a potential therapeutic target for enhancing hippocampal and amygdala-dependent memory.

We hypothesized that the inhibition of endocytosis is a key step of the mode of action of AZA-1, leading to perturbation of cellular processes dependent on proper functioning of endocytic machinery. We tested this working hypothesis by probing whether AZA-1 can alter the maturation of cathepsin D in MCF-7 epithelial cells, as a model system. We found that cell treatment with AZA-1 inhibited the conversion of 52 kDa procathepsin D into the mature 30 kDa protein. The effects induced by AZA-1 were similar to those elicited by chlorpromazine and other agents preventing proper maturation of lysosomal enzymes, indicating that the inhibition of endocytic transfer of proforms to late endosomes/lysosomess is responsible for the effect induced by the toxin. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we found no colocalization of cathepsin D and the early endosomal marker EEA-1 in control cells, where most of cathepsin D resides in late endosomes/lysosomes. Co-localization of cathepsin D and EEA-1 immunoreactivity, in turn, was found in cells exposed to AZA-1, indicating that the toxin blocks protein maturation at the early steps of endocytosis, causing accumulation of procathepsin D in early endosomes. The molecular alteration induced by AZA-1 involved both secreted and intracellular pools of procathepsin D, showing that the toxin effect does not result from a general impairment of vesicular trafficking but is the outcome of a perturbed centripetal process.

The limited available animal studies implicate a role for the \u03b15 and \u03b24 nAChR subunits in nicotine dependence and withdrawal; however studies focusing on the behavioral role of the \u03b13\u03b24* nAChR receptor subtype in nicotine dependence are lacking. Because of the apparent role of the \u03b13\u03b24* nAChR subtype in nicotine dependence, the goal of the current study was to better evaluate the involvement of this subtype in nicotine mediated behavioral responses. Using the selective \u03b13\u03b24* nAChR antagonist, \u03b1-conotoxin AuIB, we assessed the role of \u03b13\u03b24* nAChRs in acute nicotine, nicotine reward, and physical and affective nicotine withdrawal.

Belatacept combined with corticosteroids and a mycophenolic acid is indicated for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adults receiving renal transplant. Its use is contraindicated in Epstein-Barr virus seronegative or serostatus unknown patients due to increased risk of developing posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. AREAS COVERED: This review provides practical recommendations for the use of belatacept, based on safety and efficacy data from Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in de novo kidney transplant recipients. EXPERT OPINION: Treatment with belatacept is associated with improved long-term graft function, making belatacept an important option for prevention of kidney allograft rejection. Furthermore, efficacy and safety data over several years of therapy suggest that belatacept is particularly suitable for long-term immunosuppression, and the selective targeting offered by belatacept may help avoid some of the non-specific chronic safety risks associated with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids.

Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transport proteins limit the entry of xenobiotics into the fetal circulation via vectorial efflux from the placenta to the maternal circulation. Several members of the ABC family, including proteins from the ABCA, ABCB, ABCC and ABCG subfamilies, have been shown to be functional in the placenta with clinically significant roles in xenobiotic efflux. However, recent findings suggest that these transporters also protect placental tissue by preventing the cellular accumulation of cytotoxic compounds such as lipids, sterols and their derivatives. Such protective functions are likely to be particularly important in pregnancies complicated by inflammatory or oxidative stress, where the generation of toxic metabolites is enhanced. For example, ABC transporters have been shown to protect against the harmful effects of hypoxia and oxidative stress through increased expression and efflux of oxysterols and glutathione conjugated xenobiotics. However, this protective capacity may be diminished in response to the same stressors. Several studies in primary human trophoblast cells and animal models have demonstrated decreased expression and activity of placental ABC transporters with inflammatory, oxidative or metabolic stress. Several clinical studies in pregnancies complicated by inflammatory conditions such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes support these findings, although further studies are required to determine the clinical relevance of the relationships between placental ABC transporter expression and activity, and placental function in stressed pregnancies.

As the selenocysteine (SeCys) amino acid, selenium is integrated in several Se-containing proteins (selenoproteins), many of which are fundamental for cell homeostasis. Nevertheless, selenium may exert toxic effects at levels marginally above those required, mainly through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The selenium chemical speciation can strongly affect the bioavailability of this metal and its impact on metabolism, dictating the levels that can be beneficial or detrimental towards an organism. Glutathione peroxidase (GPxs) is the largest and the most studied selenoprotein family. Cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (cGPx, GPx1) and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx, GPx4) are widely distributed throughout tissues, and play a pivotal role in regulating the oxidative status in the cell. In this study we have cloned GPx1 and GPx4 genes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The constitutive mRNA expression of these GPx genes was examined in 18 trout tissues and their responsiveness to Se availability was analysed using a rainbow trout liver cell line (RTL). An inorganic (sodium selenite, Na2SeO3) and organic (selenocysteine, Cys-Se-Se-Cys) selenocompound have been used as Se sources. GPx1 activity was also tested to verify the impact of transcript changes on the enzymatic function of these molecules. To understand if the results obtained from the transcript expression analysis were due to Se bioavailability or generation of ROS, the cytoxicity of the two selenocompounds was tested by measuring the impact of Se on cell membrane integrity. Lastly, Se availability was quantified by mass spectrophotometry to determine the amount of Se in the cell culture media, the Se background due to the foetal calf serum supplement and the contribution from the two selenocompounds used in the treatments. Three isoforms of genes for both GPx1 (GPx1a, 1b1 and 1b2) and GPx4 (GPx4a1, a2 and b) have been identified.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liver injury was induced by oral administration of 30% alcohol (10mL/kg, twice per day) plus pyrazole (PRZ, 30mg/kg) with/without WAC (50, 100mg/kg, orally once per day) or silymarin (50mg/kg) for 10 days. The hepatoprotective effects were assessed by observing histopathological changes, hepatic transaminase enzymes, hepatic oxidation and antioxidant parameters, inflammatory cytokines, and alcohol metabolic enzymes in serum and hepatic gene expression level, respectively. RESULTS: Alcohol-PRZ treatment drastically increased the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in serum and liver tissues while these changes were significantly ameliorated by WAC administration (p<0.05 or 0.01). The prominent microvesicular steatosis and mild necrosis in hepatic histopathology were induced by alcohol-PRZ treatment, but notably attenuated by WAC administration. Moreover, the alcohol-PRZ treatment-induced depletions of the antioxidant components including glutathione content, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), reductase (GSH-Rd), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly ameliorated by WAC administration (p<0.05, except GSH-Rd). These results were in accordance with the modulation of NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene expression. Alcohol-PRZ treatment increased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) in hepatic tissues. However they were significantly normalized by WAC administration (p<0.05 or 0.01). In addition, WAC administration significantly attenuated the alterations of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) level in serum and hepatic gene expressions of ALDH and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acetone extract and its sub-fractions of Acacia ferruginea stem bark were subjected to assess their antioxidant potential using various in vitro systems such as DPPH(\u2022), ABTS(\u2022+) scavenging, FRAP and phosphomolybdenum reduction activities.

RESULTS: Ethyl acetate fraction (AFE) of Acacia ferruginea stem bark registered higher antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities than the crude acetone extract and other fractions. In addition, AFE exhibited that the IC50 values of DPPH (2.5\u00b5g/ml) and ABTS (1.8\u00b5g/ml) were lower when compared to the standard quercetin (12.4\u00b5g/ml and 4.7\u00b5g/ml, respectively).

With pharmacological and mechanical stress causing hypertrophy, Tln1 is up-regulated in CMs and is specifically detected at costameres, suggesting its importance in the compensatory response to CM stress. In human failing heart, CM Tln1 also increases compared with control samples from normal functioning myocardium.

The persistence of these behavioral changes suggests that long-lasting changes in gene expression, within particular regions of the brain, may contribute importantly to the addiction phenotype. Work over the past decade has demonstrated a crucial role for epigenetic mechanisms in driving lasting changes in gene expression in diverse tissues, including brain. This has prompted recent research aimed at characterizing the influence of epigenetic regulatory events in mediating the lasting effects of drugs of abuse on the brain in animal models of drug addiction. This review provides a progress report of this still early work in the field. As will be seen, there is robust evidence that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse induces changes within the brain's reward regions in three major modes of epigenetic regulation-histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs. In several instances, it has been possible to demonstrate directly the contribution of such epigenetic changes to addiction-related behavioral abnormalities. Studies of epigenetic mechanisms of addiction are also providing an unprecedented view of the range of genes and non-genic regions that are affected by repeated drug exposure and the precise molecular basis of that regulation. Work is now needed to validate key aspects of this work in human addiction and evaluate the possibility of mining this information to develop new diagnostic tests and more effective treatments for addiction syndromes.", "anno": [[152, 153, true], [346, 347, true], [513, 514, true], [717, 718, true], [795, 796, true], [1071, 1072, true], [1229, 1230, true], [1456, 1457, true], [1674, 1675, true]]}, {"id": 23391095, "text": "The supramolecular host assembly [Ga4L6](12-) [1; L = 1,5-bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzamido)naphthalene] contains a flexible, hydrophobic interior cavity that can encapsulate cationic guest molecules and catalyze a variety of chemical transformations. The Ar-CH2 bond rotational barrier for encapsulated ortho-substituted benzyl phosphonium guest molecules is sensitive to the size and shape of the host interior space. Here we examine how changes in bulk solvent (water, methanol, or DMF) or applied pressure (up to 150 MPa) affect the rotational dynamics of encapsulated benzyl phosphonium guests, as a way to probe changes in host cavity size or flexibility. When host 1 is dissolved in organic solvents with large solvent internal pressures (\u2202U/\u2202V)T, we find that the free energy barrier to Ar-CH2 bond rotation increases by 1-2 kcal/mol, compared with that in aqueous solution. Likewise, when external pressure is applied to the host-guest complex in solution, the bond rotational rates for the encapsulated guests decrease. The magnitude of these rate changes and the volumes of activation obtained using either solvent internal pressure or applied external pressure are very similar. NOE distance measurements reveal shorter average host-guest distances (~0.3 \u00c5) in organic versus aqueous solution. These experiments demonstrate that increasing solvent internal pressure or applied external pressure reduces the host cavity size or flexibility, resulting in more restricted motions for encapsulated guest molecules. Changing bulk solvent or external pressure might therefore be used to tune the physical properties or reactivity of guest molecules encapsulated in a flexible supramolecular host.", "anno": [[243, 244, true], [411, 412, true], [653, 654, true], [874, 875, true], [1021, 1022, true], [1182, 1183, true], [1297, 1298, true], [1514, 1515, true], [1694, 1695, true]]}, {"id": 23206867, "text": "A series of novel benzamides derivatives was designed and synthesized as HDAC inhibitors.

However, in a diagnostic work-up, lab-on-a-chip devices need to be compatible with complex biological samples. While it has been shown that such samples do not interfere with crucial steps in molecular diagnostics (for example antibody-antigen recognition), their effect on molecular motors is unknown. This critical and long overlooked issue is addressed here. In particular, we studied the effects of blood, cell lysates and solutions containing genomic DNA extracts on actomyosin and kinesin-microtubule-based transport, the two biomolecular motor systems that are most promising for lab-on-a-chip applications. We found that motor function is well preserved at defined dilutions of most of the investigated biological samples and demonstrated a molecular motor-driven label-free blood type test.
