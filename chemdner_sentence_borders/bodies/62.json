The vibrational configuration interaction (VCI) method constitutes a particularly promising tool in this respect. It is generally hampered though by its unfavorable scaling with respect to system size. We analyze the scaling behavior of several well-known as well as some new approximate VCI schemes in detail, which are complementary to the class of configuration selection schemes developed recently. We find that the combination of a configuration space partitioning, possibly based on configuration selection, with energetic thresholding and resonance screening provides an efficient scheme for the reduction of computational effort involved in VCI calculations while at the same time maintaining sufficient accuracy for the vibrational energies.", "anno": [[228, 229, true], [342, 343, true], [430, 431, true], [631, 632, true], [979, 980, true]]}, {"id": 23325700, "text": "Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is an important drug target for the treatment of neurological disorders. A series of 6-nitrobenzothiazole-derived semicarbazones were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as inhibitors of the rat brain MAO-B isoenzyme. Most of the compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of MAO-B, with IC(50) values in the nanomolar to micromolar range. Molecular docking studies were performed with AutoDock 4.2 to deduce the affinity and binding mode of these inhibitors toward the MAO-B active site. The free energies of binding (\u0394G) and inhibition constants (K(i)) of the docked compounds were calculated by the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) of AutoDock\u20054.2. Good correlations between the calculated and experimental results were obtained. 1-[(4-Chlorophenyl)(phenyl)methylene]-4-(6-nitrobenzothiazol-2-yl)semicarbazide emerged as the lead MAO-B inhibitor, with top ranking in both the experimental MAO-B assay (IC(50): 0.004\u00b10.001 \u03bcM) and in computational docking studies (K(i): 1.08 \u03bcM). Binding mode analysis of potent inhibitors suggests that these compounds are well accommodated by the MAO-B active site through stable hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Interestingly, the 6-nitrobenzothiazole moiety is stabilized in the substrate cavity with the aryl or diaryl residues extending up into the entrance cavity of the active site. According to our results, docking experiments could be an interesting approach for predicting the activity and binding interactions of this class of semicarbazones against MAO-B.

The protocol involves controlling the tip-sample interaction regime during AM-AFM scanning, determining the tip-sample contact geometry, calculating the peak repulsive force and normal stress over the course of the wear test, and quantifying the wear volume using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging. The peak repulsive tip-sample interaction force is estimated from a closed-form equation accompanied by an effective tip radius measurement procedure, which combines transmission electron microscopy and blind tip reconstruction.

We discuss the important role that the assumed tip shape geometry plays in calculating both the interaction forces and the contact stresses. Contact stresses are significantly affected by the tip geometry while the peak repulsive force is mainly determined by experimentally controlled parameters, specifically, the free oscillation amplitude and amplitude ratio.

To this end, snails were exposed for 48 h to different concentrations of AZM and CPF in single-chemical and binary-mixture studies, and ChE and CES activities were measured in the whole soft body tissues and hemolymph. ChE activity was measured with acetylthiocholine as substrate and CES activity was measured with four substrates: p-nitrophenyl acetate, p-nitrophenyl butyrate, 1- and 2-naphthyl acetate. Single-chemical experiments showed that CPF was a more potent inhibitor of ChE activity than AZM (350 and 27 times for the whole soft tissue and hemolymph, respectively). CES were 15 times more sensitive than ChE when the activities were measured in the whole soft tissue of the animals exposed to AZM.

Effects of the extract on sex hormones, low- and high-density lipids, hematological and biochemical parameters were examined and pathological changes of the vital organs after treatment with the extract were also investigated.

The catalytically active MTMR2 and catalytically inactive MTMR13 physically associate, although the significance of this association is not well understood. Here we show that Mtmr13 loss leads to axonal degeneration in sciatic nerves of older mice. In addition, CMT4B2-like myelin outfoldings are present in Mtmr13(-/-) nerves at postnatal day 3. Thus, Mtmr13(-/-) mice show both the initial dysmyelination and later degenerative pathology of CMT4B2. Given the key role of PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling in myelination, we investigated the state of the pathway in nerves of CMT4B models. We found that Akt activation is unaltered in Mtmr13(-/-) and Mtmr2(-/-) mice. Mtmr2 and Mtmr13 are found within the Schwann cell cytoplasm, where the proteins are partially localized to punctate compartments, suggesting that Mtmr2-Mtmr13 may dephosphorylate their substrates on specific intracellular compartments. Mtmr2-Mtmr13 substrates play essential roles in endo-lysosomal membrane traffic.

Nowadays, the notion \"colloid\" is often used referring to systems consisting of two immiscible phases, one of which is finely dispersed into the other. Research on colloids deals mostly with sols (solids dispersed in a liquid), emulsions (liquids dispersed in liquid), and foams (gas dispersed in a liquid). Because the dispersed particles are small, there is a lot of interface per unit mass. Not surprisingly, therefore, the properties of the interface have often a decisive effect on the behaviour of colloids. Water-air interfaces have a special relevance in this field: many water-insoluble molecules can be spread on water and, given the right spreading conditions and enough available surface area, their spreading proceeds until a monolayer (a one-molecule thick layer) eventually remains. Several 2D phases have been identified for such monolayers, like \"gas\", \"liquid expanded\", \"liquid condensed\", and \"solid\". The central question of this review is whether these 2D phases can also exist as colloidal systems, and what stabilizes the dispersed state in such systems. We shall present several systems capable of yielding 2D phase separation, from those based on either natural or fluorinated amphiphiles, to polymer-based ones. We shall seek for analogies in 3D and we shall try to clarify if the lines between these 2D objects play a similar role as the interfaces between 3D colloidal systems.

Scl-AbVI also reversed the deficit in bone strength in the diabetic rats, with 65% and 89% increases in maximum load at the femoral shaft and neck, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The lower bone mass in diabetic rats was associated with a 65% decrease in vertebral bone formation rate, which Scl-AbVI increased by sixfold, consistent with a pronounced anabolic effect. Nondiabetic rats filled 57% of the femoral defect, whereas diabetic rats filled only 21% (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Vescalagin was isolated using column chromatography of PWFE. This compound, at the concentration of 6.25\u2009\u00b5g/mL, exhibits the same glucose uptake improvement in insulin-resistant cells as PWFE at a 100-\u00b5g/mL dose. We postulate that vescalagin is an active component in PWFE that may alleviate the insulin resistance in mouse hepatocytes.", "anno": [[340, 341, true], [476, 477, true], [712, 713, true], [773, 774, true], [925, 926, true], [1049, 1050, true]]}]}
