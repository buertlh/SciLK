Although the toxic potential of an excess of formaldehyde has been studied, little is known on the molecular mechanisms underlying its neurotoxicity as well as on the ability of neurons to metabolize formaldehyde. To address these topics, we have used cerebellar granule neuron cultures as model system. These cultures express mRNAs of various enzymes that are involved in formaldehyde metabolism and were remarkably resistant toward acute formaldehyde toxicity. Cerebellar granule neurons metabolized formaldehyde with a rate of around 200\u00a0nmol/(h\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0mg) which was accompanied by significant increases in the cellular and extracellular concentrations of formate. In addition, formaldehyde application significantly increased glucose consumption, almost doubled the rate of lactate release from viable neurons and strongly accelerated the export of the antioxidant glutathione. The latter process was completely prevented by inhibition of the known glutathione exporter multidrug resistance protein 1. These data indicate that cerebellar granule neurons are capable of metabolizing formaldehyde and that the neuronal glycolysis and glutathione export are severely affected by the presence of formaldehyde.", "anno": [[134, 135, true], [348, 349, true], [438, 439, true], [597, 598, true], [797, 798, true], [1011, 1012, true], [1135, 1136, true], [1339, 1340, true]]}, {"id": 23356859, "text": "Abstract Objective: This study engaged in investigation of optimal formulation, characteristics analysis of Brucea javanica oil microemulsion (BJOM) in order to address safety concerns and make recommendations for improvements in BJOM safety during clinical use in vivo. Methods: Pseudo-ternary phase diagram techniques were used to determine the appropriate ratio of surfactant, cosurfactant and oil phases. Subsequent stability testing of BJOM was performed by dilution, centrifugation and accelerated stability testing. The results were expounded through additional assessment utilizing the classical thermostat method to establish the shelf life of the material. These results were utilized to evaluate the safety of BJOM by haemolytic, irritative and allergic testing in vitro. In addition, the cytotoxicity of BJOM was examined using the tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), with particular emphasis given to potential uses in cancer treatment. Results: The most suitable method of preparation for BJOM was found to be a one to one ratio (K(m) 1:1) of Solutol HS15 surfactant matched with sorbitol cosurfactant in the ratio. The microemulsion droplets of BJOM possessed a spherical shape, uniform size and average diameter of 23.8\u2009nm. The expiration date of BJOM was found to be 568\u2009d. The safety study demonstrated no hemolysis activity at the experimental BJOM concentrations; however, mild hemolysis was observed at higher concentrations of Brucea javanica oil emulsion (BJOE), a common commercially available product. Irritation observed upon BJOM treatment can be primarily attributed to Brucea javanica oil (BJO) with little influence of BJOM excipients. In addition, BJOM caused no observed hypersensitivity or other visible allergic reactions in guinea pigs. The anticancer activity curves of BJOM and BJOE demonstrate that both BJOM and BJOE inhibit Hela cells, with BJOM demonstrating significantly more dramatic anticancer activity. Conclusion: An optimal formulation of BJOM superior to commercially available products and safe for medical application such as intravenous injection has been outlined along with its anticancer activity rating.", "anno": [[18, 19, true], [269, 270, true], [278, 279, true], [407, 408, true], [521, 522, true], [665, 666, true], [781, 782, true], [997, 998, true], [1006, 1007, true], [1177, 1178, true], [1287, 1288, true], [1338, 1339, true], [1574, 1575, true], [1713, 1714, true], [1819, 1820, true], [1996, 1997, true], [2008, 2009, true], [2207, 2208, true]]}, {"id": 23356867, "text": "Non-catalytic cellulosomal CBMs (carbohydrate-binding modules) are responsible for increasing the catalytic efficiency of cellulosic enzymes by selectively putting the substrate (a wide range of poly- and oligo-saccharides) and enzyme into close contact.

Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, for instance, arises from loss-of-function mutations in Lrp5, and global deletion of Lrp5 in mice results in significantly lower bone mineral density. Since osteocytes are proposed to act as a mechanosensor in the bone, we addressed a question whether a conditional loss-of-function mutation of Lrp5 selective to osteocytes (Dmp1-Cre;Lrp5(f/f)) would alter responses to ulna loading. Loading was applied to the right ulna for 3 min (360 cycles at 2Hz) at a peak force of 2.65 N for 3 consecutive days, and the contralateral ulna was used as a non-loaded control. Young's modulus was determined using a midshaft section of the femur. The results showed that compared to age-matched littermate controls, mice lacking Lrp5 in osteocytes exhibited smaller skeletal size with reduced bone mineral density and content. Compared to controls, Lrp5 deletion in osteocytes also led to a 4.6-fold reduction in Young's modulus. In response to ulna loading, mineralizing surface, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate were diminished in mice lacking Lrp5 in osteocytes by 52%, 85%, and 69%, respectively. Collectively, the results support the notion that the loss-of-function mutation of Lrp5 in osteocytes causes suppression of mechanoresponsiveness and reduces bone mass and Young's modulus.

It is axiomatic that bones will only show an adaptive response if the applied artificial loading environment differs in a significant way from that to which the bones have been habituated by normal functional loading. It is generally assumed that this normal loading is similar between experimental groups. In the study reported here we found that this was not always the case. Male and female 17-week-old C57BL/6 mice were housed in groups of six, and a single episode (40 cycles) of non-invasive axial loading, engendering 2,200 \u03bc\u03b5 on the medial surface of the proximal tibiae in sample mice, was applied to right tibiae on alternate days for two weeks. This engendered an adaptive increase in bone mass in females, but not males. Observation revealed the main difference in behaviour between males and females was that males were involved in fights 1.3 times per hour, whereas the females never fought. We therefore housed all mice individually. In females, there was a similar significant osteogenic response to loading in cortical and trabecular bone of both grouped and individual mice. In contrast, in males, adaptive increases in the loaded compared with non-loaded control bones was only apparent in animals housed individually. Our interpretation of these findings is that the frequent vigorous fighting that occurs between young adult males housed in groups could be sufficient to engender peak strains and strain rates that equal or exceed the stimulus derived from artificial loading.

Pycnogenol lowered fasting glucose from baseline 123\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6\u2009mg/dl to 106.4\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 after 3\u2009months and to 105.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5 at the end of the study (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs controls).

The study is to find out the effect of FAs' chain length on physicochemical properties of vesicles. Methods: Decanoic acid (DA), myristic acid (MA), stearic acid (SA) and behenic acid (BA) were used as FAs. Vesicles composed of them and DMAPODA were studied about formation on microscope, calorimetric analysis, size and zeta potential. Results: On microphotographs, all of FAs could form vesicles when mixed with DMAPODA in an equi-molar ratio. However, DA/DMAPODA vesicles were disintegrated during the homogenization. Due to the asymmetry of DA/DMAPODA associate, it seems to hardly form a stable and well-packed bilayer. On thermograms, the vesicles exhibited one strong peak, indicating that FAs can be homogeneously mixed with the cationic amphiphile. The sizes of the four kinds of vesicles suspended in an aqueous solution (final pH\u20097.5) were in the same order (hundreds of nanometer) on microphotographs. But, on a light scattering machine, the mean size of MA/DMAPODA vesicle was measured to be much greater than those of the other vesicles, possibly because of the low absolute value of the zeta potential.

In this study, we directly determined the ability of human nasal mucosa to bioactivate DCBN.

We found that human fetal nasal mucosa microsomes catalyze the formation of GS-DCBN, with a Km value comparable to that of adult mouse nasal mucosa microsomes. The activity of the human nasal mucosa microsomes was inhibited by 8-methoxypsoralen, a known CYP2A inhibitor.

Furthermore, sinoatrial node cells spontaneously released more Ca\u00b2\u207a from the sarcoplasmic reticulum than did ventricular myocytes, despite comparable sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a content in both cell types. This ability of sinoatrial node cells to generate larger and rhythmic local Ca\u00b2\u207a releases was associated with increased abundance of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a-ATPase (SERCA), reduced abundance of the SERCA inhibitor phospholamban, and increased Ca\u00b2\u207a-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban and RyR. The increased phosphorylation of RyR in sinoatrial node cells may facilitate Ca\u00b2\u207a release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, whereas Ca\u00b2\u207a-dependent increase in phosphorylation of phospholamban relieves its inhibition of SERCA, augmenting the pumping rate of Ca\u00b2\u207a required to support robust, rhythmic local Ca\u00b2\u207a releases.

The interactions of these CpG sites with proteins are essential for recognition and catalysis and in many cases are characterized by the flipping of either of the cytosine bases out of the DNA helix. In this paper, we present results from molecular dynamics simulations indicating that methylation of CpG sites suppresses spontaneous extra-helical conformations of either of the two cytosines. Thus, cytosines in unmethylated sites flip out easier than in hemimethylated sites and the latter flip out easier than in fully methylated sites. The different propensities for base flipping is observed not only between the cytosines that differ in their methylation states but also between the cytosines on the complementary strand. From alchemical mutation calculations, we find that methylation of one of the cytosines increases the free energy of the extra-helical conformation by 10.3-16.5 kJ/mol and this increase is additive with respect to the second methylation. Potential of mean force calculations confirm these results and reveal that cytosines in unmethylated sites favor flipping via the major-groove pathway. We perform several analyses to correlate this behavior with structural changes induced by the different methylation states of the CpG site. However, we demonstrate that the driving force for these propensities is the change in the electronic distribution around the pyrimidine ring upon methylation. In particular, unmethylated cytosine interacts more favorably (primarily via electrostatic forces) with solvent water molecules than methylated cytosine. This is observed for, both, extra-helical cytosines and intra-helical cytosines in which the cytosine on the complementary strand flips out and water molecules enter the DNA double-helix and substitute the hydrogen bonds with the orphan guanine.

This review summarizes the existing data published for ceftazidime-avibactam, including relevant chemistry, mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. Although not a \u03b2-lactam, the chemical structure of avibactam closely resembles portions of the cephem bicyclic ring system, and avibactam has been shown to bond covalently to \u03b2-lactamases. Very little is known about the potential for avibactam to select for resistance. The addition of avibactam greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] reduction) improves the activity of ceftazidime versus most species of Enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of \u03b2-lactamase enzyme(s). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of avibactam also improves the activity of ceftazidime (~fourfold MIC reduction). Limited data suggest that the addition of avibactam does not improve the activity of ceftazidime versus Acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas spp.). The pharmacokinetics of avibactam follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration of ceftazidime. The maximum plasma drug concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of avibactam increase linearly with doses ranging from 50\u00a0mg to 2,000\u00a0mg. The mean volume of distribution and half-life of 22 L (~0.3 L/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to ceftazidime. Like ceftazidime, avibactam is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. Pharmacodynamic data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is rapidly bactericidal versus \u03b2-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by ceftazidime alone.Clinical trials to date have reported that ceftazidime-avibactam is as effective as standard carbapenem therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative isolates. The safety and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam has been reported in three phase I pharmacokinetic studies and two phase II clinical studies. Ceftazidime-avibactam appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.In conclusion, avibactam serves to broaden the spectrum of ceftazidime versus \u00df-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. The exact roles for ceftazidime-avibactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. Potential future roles for ceftazidime-avibactam include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant Gram-negative-bacilli producing extended-spectrum \u00df-lactamase (ESBL), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) and/or AmpC \u00df-lactamases. In addition, ceftazidime-avibactam may be used in combination (with metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial infections.

To examine the mechanism of angioendotheliomatosis associated with cysteamine toxicity, we examined the effect of cysteamine on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC). METHODS: After cysteamine exposure (range 0-3.0\u00a0mM) during 24\u00a0h, cell viability was measured using water soluble tetrazolium salt-1 (WST-1) in both control HDMVEC and fibroblasts. Cell proliferation and apoptosis rate were measured in HDMVEC by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and caspase 3 and caspase 7 activity, respectively. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) was measured in HDMVEC after cysteamine exposure of 0, 0.1 or 1.0\u00a0mM. Medium and cysteamine were refreshed every 6\u00a0h to mimic the in vivo situation. Next, cell viability in HDMVEC was measured after 24\u00a0h of GSH exposure (range 0-10.0\u00a0mM). RESULTS: HDMVEC viability and proliferation increased after cysteamine exposure 0.03-3.0\u00a0mM (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and 0.03-1.0\u00a0mM (p\u2009=\u20090.01) respectively; cell viability in fibroblasts was not affected by incubation with cysteamine. Apoptosis remained unaffected by incubation with 0-1.0\u00a0mM cysteamine, 3.0\u00a0mM caused increased apoptosis.

Nicotine-seeking was examined following the 10th day of abstinence under a within-session extinction/cue-induced reinstatement paradigm. RESULTS: Intake was higher at the 10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg dose as compared to the 5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg dose; however, intake did not differ within doses prior to wheel assignment.

PEITC has been reported to be a mechanism-based inactivator of some P450s. We describe here the possible mechanism for the inactivation of human CYP2E1 by PEITC, as well as the putative intermediate that might be involved in the bioactivation of PEITC. PEITC inactivated recombinant CYP2E1 with a partition ratio of 12, and the inactivation was not inhibited in the presence of glutathione (GSH) and not fully recovered by dialysis. The inactivation of CYP2E1 by PEITC is due to both heme destruction and protein modification, with the latter being the major pathway for inactivation. GSH-adducts of phenethyl isocyanate (PIC) and phenethylamine were detected during the metabolism by CYP2E1, indicating formation of PIC as a reactive intermediate following P450-catalyzed desulfurization of PEITC. Surprisingly, PIC bound covalently to CYP2E1 to form protein adducts but did not inactivate the enzyme. Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy analysis of the inactivated CYP2E1 apo-protein suggests that a reactive sulfur atom generated during desulfurization of PEITC is involved in the inactivation of CYP2E1.

All compounds significantly altered kidney proximal tubule morphology but there was no difference in the incidence of apoptotic cells within the kidney between control and exposed in either males or females. Liver histology was altered by ACE and GEM exposure. Parental exposure to pharmaceuticals did not increase developmental abnormalities, hatching success, or mortality in embryos. Yet, direct exposure of embryos to ACE increased developmental abnormalities and mortality; exposure to 0.5\u03bcgL(-1) of all pharmaceuticals increased mortality. CBZ decreased plasma 11-ketotestosterone concentrations in males and females. Overall, these data suggest that low concentration, chronic exposure of fish to pharmaceuticals impacts fish development as well as multiple organ systems in adult fish, leading to effects on reproduction and histology of liver and kidney. These results are significant in understanding the consequences of chronic, low concentration pharmaceutical exposure to fish and suggest that exposed populations are at risk of negative impacts to reproduction and health.", "anno": [[172, 173, true], [417, 418, true], [610, 611, true], [749, 750, true], [850, 851, true], [1058, 1059, true], [1111, 1112, true], [1237, 1238, true], [1396, 1397, true], [1474, 1475, true], [1714, 1715, true], [1937, 1938, true]]}]}
