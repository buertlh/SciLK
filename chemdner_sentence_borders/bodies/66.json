Combinative particle size reduction technologies have been developed to overcome the drawbacks of the standard techniques. The H 42 combinative technology consists of a drug pre-treatment by means of spray-drying followed by standard high pressure homogenization. In the present paper, spray-drying process parameters influencing the diminution effectiveness, such as drug and surfactant concentration, were systematically analyzed. Subsequently, the untreated and pre-treated drug powders were homogenized for 20 cycles at 1500bar. For untreated, micronized glibenclamide, the particle size analysis revealed a mean particle size of 772nm and volume-based size distribution values of 2.686\u03bcm (d50%) and 14.423\u03bcm (d90%). The use of pre-treated material (10:1 glibenclamide/docusate sodium salt ratio spray-dried as ethanolic solution) resulted in a mean particle size of 236nm and volume-based size distribution values of 0.131\u03bcm (d50%) and 0.285\u03bcm (d90%). These results were markedly improved compared to the standard process. The nanosuspensions were further transferred into tablet formulations. Wet granulation, freeze-drying and spray-drying were investigated as downstream methods to produce dry intermediates. Regarding the dissolution rate, the rank order of the downstream processes was as follows: Spray-drying>freeze-drying>wet granulation. The best drug release (90% within 10min) was obtained for tablets produced with spray-dried nanosuspension containing 2% mannitol as matrix former. In comparison, the tablets processed with micronized glibenclamide showed a drug release of only 26% after 10min.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether miR-21 mediated resistance of the gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (DDP). Our study found that the expression of miR-21 upregulated in the cisplatin resistant cell line SGC7901/DDP compared to its parental line SGC7901. Moreover, over-expression of miR-21 significantly decreased antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induced by cisplatin, while knockdown of miR-21 dramatically increased antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induction by cisplatin. In addition, miR-21 induced cell survival and cisplatin resistance through downregulating the expression of phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and activation of Akt pathway.

This results from the relative balance between the electrostatic attraction between the SDS and amine nitrogen group which decreases as the charge density decreases with increasing pH, the ion-dipole interaction between the amine nitrogen and SDS sulfate group which is dominant at higher pH, and the hydrophobic interalkyl chain interaction between bound SDS molecules which changes with oligoamine molecular weight.", "anno": [[226, 227, true], [392, 393, true], [590, 591, true], [782, 783, true], [1200, 1201, true]]}, {"id": 22381584, "text": "Cholinergic neurons of the pontine laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) are importantly involved in neurobiological mechanisms governing states of arousal such as sleep and wakefulness as well as other appetitive behaviors, such as drug-seeking. Accordingly, mechanisms controlling their excitability are important to elucidate if we are to understand how these LDT neurons generate arousal states. Glutamate mediates the vast majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate CNS and while presence of glutamate input in the LDT has been shown and ionotropic responses to glutamate have been reported in the LDT, characterization of metabotropic responses is lacking. Therefore, electrophysiological responses and changes in levels of intracellular Ca(2+) in mouse cholinergic LDT neurons following application of specific mGluR agonists and antagonists were examined. Unexpectedly, both the mGluR(5)specific agonist, CHPG, and the group II mGluR (mGlu(2/3)) agonist, LY379268 (LY), induced a TTX-insensitive outward current/hyperpolarization. Both outward currents were significantly reduced by the mGluR antagonist MCPG and the CHPG-induced current was blocked by the specific mGluR(5) antagonist MTEP. Concurrent Ca(2+)imaging revealed that while CHPG actions did include release of Ca(2+) from CPA/thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores, actions of LY did not. Both CHPG- and LY-induced outward currents were mediated by a TEA-sensitive potassium conductance. The large-conductance, Ca(2+)-dependent potassium (BK) channel blocker, iberiotoxin, attenuated CHPG actions. Consistent with actions on the BK conductance, CHPG enhanced the amplitude of the fast component of the after hyperpolarizing potential, concurrent with a reduction in the firing rate. We conclude that stimulation of mGluR(5) and group II (mGluR(2/3)) elicits postsynaptically-mediated outward currents/hyperpolarizations in cholinergic LDT neurons. Effects of glutamatergic input would be, thus, expected not only to be excitation via stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and mGluR(1), but also inhibition via actions at mGluR(5) and mGluR(2/3) on these neurons. As these two processes counteract each other, these surprising findings necessitate revision of predictions regarding the net level of excitation generated by glutamate input to cholinergic LDT cells and, by extension, the functional outcome of glutamate transmission on processes which these neurons regulate.

In a staggered cross-sectional design, we tested associations with coronary artery calcium (CAC), measured by computed tomography a median of 10 years later, and with common and internal carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), measured by B-mode ultrasonography on two occasions a median of 4 years later and a median of 10 years later. We hypothesized that lower concentrations of each vitamin D metabolite would be associated with increased risk of CAC and greater carotid IMT.RESULTSAt the time metabolites were measured, mean age was 32.4 years and mean duration of diabetes was 7.5 years. The prevalence and severity of CAC tended to be lower-not higher-with lower concentrations of each vitamin D metabolite. For instance, in a fully adjusted multinomial logistic model, a 25 nmol/L lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D was associated with a 0.8-fold decrease in the odds of having higher CAC (95% CI 0.68-0.96, P = 0.01).

Participants carried out a baseline session and were then randomly assigned to one of six conditions formed by combining three different doses of caffeine (0, 62.5 and 125\u00a0mg per drink) with either no alcohol or 4.3\u00a0% alcohol.

The dog is the only large mammal, besides humans, that commonly develops spontaneous prostate cancer. Canine prostate cancer features many similarities with its human counterpart. We sought to develop a canine model of prostate cancer that would more fully represent the features of human prostate cancer than existing models. METHODS: The Ace-1 canine prostate cancer cell line was injected transabdominally under transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance into the prostates of immunosuppressed, intact, adult male dogs. Tumor progression was monitored by TRUS imaging. Some dogs were subjected to positron emission tomography (PET) for tumor detection. Time of euthanasia was determined based on tumor size, impingement on urethra, and general well-being. Euthanasia was followed by necropsy and histopathology. RESULTS: Ace-1 tumor cells grew robustly in every dog injected. Tumors grew in subcapsular and parenchymal regions of the prostate. Tumor tissue could be identified using PET. Histological findings were similar to those observed in human prostate cancer. Metastases to lungs and lymph nodes were detected, predominantly in dogs with intraprostatic tumors.

Controls received saline (IT) or air only (IH). LDH and protein were significantly different from the control in the LPS-IH group (days 1 and 3) with a somewhat inconclusive outcome in the LPS-IT group due to the effects occurring in the control. Total cell counts were equally elevated with similar time-course changes in the LPS-IT and -IH groups. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were indistinguishable amongst LPS-dosed rats. Again, IT-dosed control rats displayed markedly higher background levels than those dosed by inhalation. Similarly NOE was significantly elevated on post-LPS day 1 as was Penh. In summary, the LPS-aerosol dose delivered by nose-only exposure over 6 h was equally potent as the 2-times higher LPS-IT bolus dose on post-LPS day 1 with somewhat faster recovery thereafter. The climax and discriminatory power of the non-invasive endpoints matched those determined terminally. This supports the conclusion that the pharmacological efficacy and side effects of inhalation pharmaceuticals designed to mitigate ALI can better be identified by LPS-aerosol than by LPS-IT. Non-invasive time-course measurements may deliver apt information both on the efficacious dose as well as the dosing intervals required to maintain the targeted efficacy using a minimum of experimental animals.

Given the high prevalence of both conditions, the hypothesis was that TRD would be significantly associated with MetS. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 203 inpatients with MDD, assessed for the treatment resistance, MetS and its components, and severity of MDD. Diagnoses and evaluations were made with SCID based on DSM-IV, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: TRD prior to study entry was found in 26.1\u00a0% of patients, while MetS was observed in 33.5\u00a0% of patients. The prevalence of MetS did not differ significantly between TRD and non-TRD patients. In addition, the frequency of the altered values of particular components of the MetS or cardiovascular risk factors was not associated with treatment resistance in depressed patients. Patients with TRD were older, had a higher number of lifetime episodes of depression and suicide attempts, and longer duration of MDD compared to non-TRD patients.

Patients with diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome have a significantly increased risk of heart attack and stroke compared with people with normal insulin sensitivity. Decreased insulin sensitivity in cardiovascular tissues as well as in traditional targets of insulin metabolic signaling, such as skeletal muscle, is an underlying abnormality in obesity, hypertension, and T2D. In the vasculature, insulin signaling plays a critical role in normal vascular function via endothelial cell nitric oxide production and modulation of Ca(2+) handling and sensitivity in vascular smooth muscle cells. Available evidence suggests that impaired vascular insulin sensitivity may be an early, perhaps principal, defect of vascular function and contributor to the pathogenesis of vascular disease in persons with obesity, hypertension, and T2D. In the overweight and obese individual, as well as in persons with hypertension, systemic and vascular insulin resistance often occur in concert with elevations in plasma aldosterone. Indeed, basic and clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated plasma aldosterone levels predict the development of insulin resistance and that aldosterone directly interferes with insulin signaling in vascular tissues. Furthermore, elevated plasma aldosterone levels are associated with increased heart attack and stroke risk. Conversely, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism reduces cardiovascular risk in these patient populations.

Orientational fluctuations of SG trigger hydrogen bond breaking that sets off the hydronium ion motion. The activation free energy of this process is 0.3 eV (\u00b10.1 eV). The soliton-like nature of this mechanism is owed to the trigonal symmetry of sulfonate anions and exceptionally strong interfacial hydrogen bonding. These insights should stimulate surface conductance studies at SG monolayers with sulfonic acid groups, and they bolster efforts in designing proton conducting polymers conducive to fuel cell operation above ~100 \u00b0C.", "anno": [[253, 254, true], [365, 366, true], [503, 504, true], [607, 608, true], [671, 672, true], [821, 822, true], [1038, 1039, true]]}, {"id": 23411270, "text": "The effects of different freezing treatments on the quality changes of bighead carp heads were evaluated in terms of pH value, TBARS, TVB-N, K-value, biogenic amine, total aerobic counts (TACs), drip loss, cooking loss and electrical conductivity (EC) during ice storage.

For such approaches to be useful, efficient and reliable data analysis and hit detection methods are also required. Assessment of chemical effects on neuronal network activity using microelectrode arrays (MEAs) has been proposed as a screening tool for neurotoxicity. The current study examined a Bayesian data analysis approach for assessing effects of a 30 chemical training set on activity of primary cortical neurons grown in multi-well MEA plates. Each well of the MEA plate contained 64 microelectrodes and the data set contains the number of electrical spikes registered by each electrode over the course of each experiment. A Bayesian data analysis approach was developed and then applied to several different parsings of the data set to produce probability determinations for hit selection and ranking. This methodology results in an approach that is approximately 74% sensitive in detecting chemicals in the training set known to alter neuronal function (23 expected positives) while being 100% specific in detecting chemicals expected to have no effect (7 expected negatives). Additionally, this manuscript demonstrates that the Bayesian approach may be combined with a previously published weighted mean firing rate approach in order to produce a more robust hit detection method. In particular, when combined with the weighted mean firing rate approach, the joint analysis produces a sensitivity of approximately 96% and a specificity of 100%. These results demonstrate the utility of a novel approach to analysis of MEA data and support the use of neuronal networks grown on MEAs as a for neurotoxicity screening approach.", "anno": [[172, 173, true], [288, 289, true], [440, 441, true], [625, 626, true], [804, 805, true], [984, 985, true], [1260, 1261, true], [1465, 1466, true], [1629, 1630, true], [1809, 1810, true]]}, {"id": 23512732, "text": "Nasal polyps are chronic inflammatory conditions characterized by myofibroblast differentiation and extracelluar matrix accumulation. The major catechin from green tea is (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has garnered attention for its potential to prevent oxidative stress-related diseases. The purpose of this study was twofold: (i) to determine the effect of EGCG on fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix accumulation in transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21-induced nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDFs) and (ii) to determine if the antioxidative effect of EGCG on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in TGF-\u03b21-induced NPDFs is involved in the aforementioned processes. TGF-\u03b21-induced NPDFs were treated with or without EGCG. \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen type I mRNA were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. \u03b1-SMA protein was also detected using immunofluorescent staining. The amount of total soluble collagen was analyzed by Sircol collagen assay. ROS activity was measured by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. EGCG significantly inhibited expressions of \u03b1-SMA and collagen type I mRNA and reduced \u03b1-SMA and collagen protein levels at concentrations of 10-20 \u00b5g/mL. EGCG also inhibited TGF-\u03b21-induced ROS production at the same concentrations. These results suggest the possibility that EGCG may be effective at inhibiting the development of nasal polyps through an anti-oxidant effect.

At midgestation, the telencephalic vesicles are characterized by well developed radial glia cells (RGCs), the first differentiated astrocytes and a basic vascular network mainly built of radial vessels. RGCs have been recognized to contribute to cerebral cortex neuro-vascular architecture and have also been demonstrated to act as a significant source of neural cells (Rakic, Brain Res 33:471-476, 1971; Malatesta et al, Development 127:5253-5263, 2000). According to our hypothesis CXCL12, a potent migration and differentiation chemokine released by RGCs, may act as a linking factor coordinating neuroblast migration with vessel growth and patterning through the activation of different ligand/receptor axes. The obtained results support this hypothesis showing that together with CXCR4/CXCR7-reactive neuroblasts, which migrate in close association with CXCL12 RGCs, layer-specific subsets of CXCL12 RGCs and astrocytes specifically contact the microvessel wall. Moreover, the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 system appears to be directly involved in microvessel growth, its members being differentially expressed in angiogenically activated microvessels and vascular sprouts.", "anno": [[269, 270, true], [472, 473, true], [725, 726, true], [982, 983, true], [1237, 1238, true], [1438, 1439, true]]}]}
