Such resistant animals also do not show an activated microglia phenotype, suggesting a relation between microglial activation and METH-induced neurotoxicity. To date, the astrocyte response in such resistance has not been examined. Thus, this study examined glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD11b protein expression in striata of animals administered saline or a neurotoxic regimen of METH on post-natal days 60 and/or 90 (Saline:Saline, Saline:METH, METH:Saline, METH:METH). Consistent with previous work, animals experiencing acute toxicity (Saline:METH) showed both activated microglia and astocytes, whereas those resistant to the acute toxicity (METH:METH) did not show activated microglia. Interestingly, GFAP expression remained elevated in rats exposed to METH at PND60 (METH:Saline), and was not elevated further in resistant rats treated for the second time with METH (METH:METH). These data suggest that astrocytes remain reactive up to 30\u00a0days post-METH exposure.

The PHC5 for copper was then estimated (6.8\u2009\u00b5g/L; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-13.6\u2009\u00b5g/L), by fitting a log-normal distribution to the population threshold concentrations obtained. The close overlap between the present study's estimate of the PHC5 and a field-derived threshold concentration suggests that the population-level SSD approach provides a reasonable level of protection for species richness in the natural environment. By contrast, and counterintuitively, the authors' estimate was comparable with the individual-level HC5 reported in the European Union risk assessment. Although the present study cannot determine the underlying reasons for the similar figures, the result provides an indication that the margin between individual-level and population-level benchmarks derived from SSD approaches can be very small. The results therefore suggest that attention is needed to achieve population-level protection using an individual-level SSD approach.

Direct Hg analyzers, which use thermal decomposition and atomic absorption spectrometry, have recently gained popularity for determining organic Hg after procedural solvent extraction from some environmental media, although quantitative recovery from lipid-rich materials, such as fish liver, has been problematic. The authors developed a new method by which organic Hg in fish liver and muscle is estimated by the difference between direct measurements of inorganic Hg in an acid extract and total Hg in whole tissue. The method was validated by analysis of a certified reference material (DOLT-4 dogfish liver) and naturally contaminated fish tissues with comparison to an established Hg speciation method (gas chromatography cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry). Recovery of organic Hg from DOLT-4, estimated by difference, averaged 99\u2009\u00b1\u20095% of the mean certified value for methylmercury. In most liver samples and all muscle samples, estimates of organic Hg from the proposed method were indiscernible from direct speciation measurements of methylmercury (99%\u2009\u00b1\u20096%). Estimation of organic Hg by the difference between total Hg and inorganic Hg was less accurate in liver samples with a high percentage of inorganic Hg (90%). This was because of the increased uncertainty that results from estimating a third value (i.e., organic Hg) by using the difference between two large concentrations (inorganic and total Hg). The proposed method is a useful tool for examining the speciation of Hg in fish muscle and liver, and by extension, potentially other tissues and environmental media.

The Staphylococcus aureus nanA gene, encoding NAL, was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The protein, purified in high yield, has all the properties expected of a class I NAL. The S. aureus NAL which contains no natural cysteine residues was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a cysteine in place of Lys165 in the enzyme active site. Subsequently chemical mutagenesis completely converted the cysteine into \u03b3-thialysine through dehydroalanine (Dha) as demonstrated by ESI-MS. Initial kinetic characterisation showed that the protein containing \u03b3-thialysine regained 17 % of the wild-type activity. To understand the reason for this lower activity, we solved X-ray crystal structures of the wild-type S. aureus NAL, both in the absence of, and in complex with, pyruvate. We also report the structures of the K165C variant, and the K165-\u03b3-thialysine enzyme in the presence, or absence, of pyruvate. These structures reveal that \u03b3-thialysine in NAL is an excellent structural mimic of lysine.

At its optimum pH, the thialysine-containing enzyme showed almost 30 % of the activity of the wild-type enzyme at its pH optimum. The lowered activity and altered pH profile of the unnatural amino acid-containing enzyme can be rationalised by imbalances of the ionisation states of residues within the active site when the pK(a) of the residue at position 165 is perturbed by replacement with \u03b3-thialysine.

In Neuro 2a cells that lacked CPE, PC1/3 and PC2, proglucagon co-localised with the Golgi marker p115 as determined by quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy.

It remains to be fully elucidated whether use of metformin, an insulin sensitizer, and/or sulfonylureas, insulin secretagogues, affect cancer incidence in subjects with T2DM. MATERIAL & METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis using PubMed, of randomized control trials (RCTs), cohorts, and case-control studies published through July 2012 that assess effects of metformin and/or sulfonylurea sulfonylureas on cancer risk at any site, in subjects with T2DM. Fixed and random effects meta-analysis models were used, and the effect size was summarized as relative risk (RR) for RCTs/cohorts and as odds ratio (OR) for the case-control studies. RESULTS: Analysis of 24 metformin studies in subjects with T2DM showed that metformin use is associated with reduced risk for the development of cancer, in both cohort (RR=0.70 [95% CI=0.67-0.73]) and case-control studies (OR=0.90 [95% CI=0.84-0.98]), but this finding was not supported by RCTs (RR=1.01[95% CI=0.81-1.26]). Data from 18 sulfonylurea studies in subjects with T2DM showed that sulfonylurea use is associated with an increase in all-cancer risk, in cohort studies (RR=1.55 [95% CI=1.48 -1.63]), though data from RCTs (RR=1.17 [95% CI=0.95-1.45]) and case-control studies (OR=1.02 [95% CI=0.93-1.13]) failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect.

The mannose receptor (MR) is known to be involved in the recognition and internalization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We present a new assembly process to produce nanocarriers with variable surface densities of mannose targeting ligands in a single step, using kinetically-controlled, block copolymer-directed assembly. Nanocarrier association with murine macrophage J774 cells expressing the MR is examined as a function of incubation time and temperature, nanocarrier size, dose, and PEG corona properties. Amphiphilic diblock copolymers are prepared with terminal hydroxyl, methoxy, or mannoside functionality and incorporated into nanocarrier formulations at specific ratios by Flash NanoPrecipitation. Association of nanocarriers protected by a hydroxyl-terminated PEG corona with J774 cells is size dependent, while nanocarriers with methoxy-terminated PEG coronas do not associate with cells, regardless of size. Specific targeting of the MR is investigated using nanocarriers having 0-75% mannoside-terminated PEG chains in the PEG corona. This is a wider range of mannose densities than has been previously studied. Maximum nanocarrier association is attained with 9% mannoside-terminated PEG chains, increasing uptake more than 3-fold compared to non-targeted nanocarriers with a 5kgmol(-1) methoxy-terminated PEG corona. While a 5kgmol(-1) methoxy-terminated PEG corona prevents non-specific uptake, a 1.8kgmol(-1) methoxy-terminated PEG corona does not sufficiently protect the nanocarriers from nonspecific association. There is continuous uptake of MR-targeted nanocarriers at 37\u00b0C, but a saturation of association at 4\u00b0C. The majority of targeted nanocarriers associated with J774E cells are internalized at 37\u00b0C and uptake is receptor-dependent, diminishing with competitive inhibition by dextran.

For both types of perfume molecules, complex phase behavior is observed. The phase behavior depends upon the concentration, surfactant/perfume composition, and type of perfume. The more hydrophilic perfume PE promotes the formation of more highly curved structures. At relatively low surfactant concentrations, small globular micelles, L1, are formed. These become perfume droplets, L(sm), stabilized by the surfactant at much higher perfume solution compositions. At higher surfactant concentrations, the tendency of LAS-6 to form more planar structures is evident. The more hydrophobic linalool promotes the formation of more planar structures. Combined with the greater tendency of LAS-6 to form planar structures, this results in the planar structures dominating the phase behavior for the LAS-6/linalool mixtures.

(Co-) extruded samples were characterized in terms of solid state (XRD, SEM), in vitro drug release, core/coat adhesion, and bioavailability. Based on the polymer screening, two polymer combinations were selected for co-extrusion: ethylcellulose (core) combined with Soluplus\u00ae (coat) and polycaprolactone (core) with PEO (coat). These combinations were successfully co-extruded. XRD revealed that DS remained crystalline during extrusion in ethylcellulose, Soluplus\u00ae, polycaprolactone, and PEO. The polycaprolactone/PEO combination could be processed at a lower temperature (70\u00b0C), vs. 140\u00b0C for ethylcellulose/Soluplus\u00ae. The maximum drug load in core and coat depended on the extrusion temperature and the die dimensions, while adhesion between core and coat was mainly determined by the drug load and by the extrusion temperature. In vitro drug release from the co-extruded formulations was reflected in the in vivo behavior: formulations with a higher DS content in the coat (i.e., faster drug release) resulted in higher Cmax and higher AUC values.

In addition, concordance in assessments between reporters and evaluators, trend shifts in reporting, and detection of potentially new adverse drug interaction signals were studied. METHODS: Data on bleeding events reported between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2005 were retrieved from the Norwegian spontaneous reporting system database. RESULTS: Of 327 case reports of non-warfarin-associated bleeding events, 270 reports (82.6\u00a0%) were characterised as serious and 69 (21.1\u00a0%) had a fatal outcome. One hundred and eighty-seven bleeds (57.5\u00a0%) were gastrointestinal, 57 (17.4\u00a0%) were cerebral, and 81 (24.8\u00a0%) were from other bleeding sites. The bleeding sites differed with respect to the patient's age, drug use, diagnoses and outcomes. Of drugs associated with bleeding, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/COX-2 inhibitors (145 reports) and acetylsalicylic acid (128 reports) were most frequently used.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were used as biochemical markers of MTX-induced hepatic injury. The levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS, a marker of lipid peroxidation) and activities of hepatic antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were used to analyze the oxidative stress-mediated lipid peroxidation in liver sections. Our results showed that MTX administration significantly increased ALT, ASP, and ALP levels. TBARS, CAT, and GST levels were also markedly increased in liver after MTX administration. RVT treatment significantly prevented MTX-induced hepatotoxicity, as indicated by AST, ALT, and ALP levels and liver histopathology. Moreover, administration of RVT significantly decreased the elevated levels of TBARS and activities of CAT and GST in the liver compared to MTX-treated group.

Concentrations of DPMA isomers when detected in Lake Ontario biota were greater than that of total DP for all trophic levels. The prevalence of 1,3-DPMA in the food web, and especially in lake trout, may be due to obstruction of the existing carbon double bond to enzyme attack, rendering it less readily metabolized. To examine this hypothesis, biotransformation kinetic experiments using in vitro lake trout liver microsomal exposures were performed. Zero-order depletion rate constants for 1,3- and 1,5-DPMA were 92.2 and 134.6 pmole h(-1) , respectively, with corresponding half-lives of 2.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u2009h (1,3-DPMA) and 1.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2009h (1,5-DPMA). Furthermore, the 1,5-isomer was depleted to a greater extent than 1,3-DPMA. Specific biotransformation products were not identified. These data support the hypothesis that 1,5-DPMA is more readily metabolized than 1,3-DPMA by lake trout. The present study also shows that the concentrations of these isomers, which the authors speculate might be unintended impurities or byproducts in some technical DP formulations, exceed that of the intended product in biota.

Osteopontin (OPN) is also elevated in the plasma and skeleton of Alpl(-/-) mice. Phosphorylated OPN is known to inhibit mineralization, however, the phosphorylation status of the increased OPN found in Alpl(-/-) mice is unknown. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse line expressing human TNAP under control of an osteoblast-specific Col1a1 promoter (Col1a1-Tnap). The transgene is expressed in osteoblasts, periosteum, and cortical bones, and plasma levels of TNAP in mice expressing Col1a1-Tnap are 10-20 times higher than those of wild-type mice. The Col1a1-Tnap animals are healthy and exhibit increased bone mineralization by microCT analysis. Crossbreeding of Col1a1-Tnap transgenic mice to Alpl(-/-) mice rescues the lethal hypophosphatasia phenotype characteristic of this disease model. Osteoblasts from [Col1a1-Tnap] mice mineralize better than non-transgenic controls and osteoblasts from [Col1a1-Tnap(+/-) ; Alpl(-/-) ] mice are able to mineralize to the level of Alpl(+/-) heterozygous osteoblasts, while Alpl(-/-) osteoblasts show no mineralization. We found that the increased levels of OPN in bone tissue of Alpl(-/-) mice are comprised of phosphorylated forms of OPN while WT and [Col1a1-Tnap(+/-) ; Alpl(-/-) ] mice had both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of OPN. OPN from [Col1a1-Tnap] osteoblasts were more phosphorylated than non-transgenic control cells. Titanium dioxide-liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that OPN peptides derived from Alpl(-/-) bone and osteoblasts yielded a higher proportion of phosphorylated peptides than samples from WT mice, and at least two phosphopeptides, p(S(174) FQVS(178) DEQY(182) PDAT(186) DEDLT(191) )SHMK and FRIp(S(299) HELES(304) S(305) S(306) S(307) )EVN, with one non-localized site each, appear to be preferred sites of TNAP action on OPN. Our data suggest that the pro-mineralization role of TNAP may be related not only to its accepted pyrophosphatase activity but also to its ability to modify the phosphorylation status of OPN. \u00a9 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "anno": [[259, 260, true], [340, 341, true], [488, 489, true], [624, 625, true], [809, 810, true], [908, 909, true], [1055, 1056, true], [1323, 1324, true], [1552, 1553, true], [1647, 1648, true], [2107, 2108, true], [2299, 2300, true], [2354, 2355, true]]}, {"id": 23427137, "text": "A new liquid crystalline (LC) phase with uniform tilt, local polar order and capability of symmetry breaking is found for a bent-core mesogen combining a 4-cyanoresorcinol unit with two azobenzene wings.
