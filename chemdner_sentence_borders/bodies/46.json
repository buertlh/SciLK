Higher drug loads resulted in faster release with behenic acid releasing drug over longer periods relative to stearic acid. The in vitro drug release was pH-dependent at low drug load with the release being slower at lower pH.

Through the stabilization of switch II, the local conformational change at the catalytic center is further relayed to the neck-linker element that fully docks to the catalytic core to produce the power stroke. Because the neck linker is a sole element that connects the partner heads in dimeric KIFs, this tight structural coordination between the catalytic center and neck linker enables inter-domain communication between the partner heads.

Herein, we investigated the effect of a natural neuroprotective flavonoid, calycopterin, on H2O2-induced disruption of phase II detoxifying enzyme system and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. METHODS: PC12 cells were treated with 25, 50 and 100\u03bcM of calycopterin for 3h, followed by adding H2O2 (150\u03bcM) for 24h. The extent of apoptosis was assessed by comet assay. The level of phosphorylated CREB, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutamylcysteine synthetase (\u03b3-GCS) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were measured by western blot method. The concentration of glutathione (GSH) was determined in whole cell lysate using dithionitrobenzoic acid method. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured by colorimetric assay. RESULT: Morphological analysis of protection induced by calycopterin, determined by comet assay, showed that calycopterin reduced DNA in tail. We found that H2O2 decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while, calycopterin prevented this decrease in MMP in presence of H2O2. In H2O2-treated cells, calycopterin also suppressed cytochrome C release to cytosol that is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in survived cells. Moreover, calycopterin, in presence of H2O2 inhibited the decrease caused by oxidative stress in stress-sensing transcription factors, CREB and Nrf2, which play an important role in antioxidant capacity of the cell. There was also an increase in \u03b3-GCS and HO-1 levels in calycopterin pretreated cells. In the presence of H2O2, calycopterin inhibited decrease in GSH level and SOD activity.

With the support of classical molecular dynamics simulations using empirical force-fields, we develop an argumentation to show that the value of 127\u00b0 is an unrealistic estimate and that a value of the order of 95-100\u00b0 should be expected.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we examined the proposed penetration enhancing properties of spilanthol, an N-alkylamide abundantly present in several Asteraceae plants like Spilanthes acmella L., on three model drugs (caffeine, testosterone and ibuprofen). Moreover, as plants are frequently contaminated with toxic environmental substances, the mutual influence on the transdermal behavior between spilanthol and six model mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, fumonisin B1, citrinin, zearalenone, T-2 toxin) was investigated. RESULTS: Spilanthol exhibits component and concentration dependent penetration enhancing effects. No significant penetration enhancing effect for ibuprofen has been observed, but with increasing spilanthol concentration (from 0 up to 1w/V%), the permeability of caffeine increased, resulting in an enhancing ratio (ER) of 4.60.

As a downstream consequence, the potential result of overinterpretation of guidance or occasional widespread and premature implementation of responses to health authority inspections, industry may be contributing significantly to raising the bar on some processes related to day-to-day practices in the bioanalytical laboratory.

TCDD increased the expression of 40% of the genes of the epidermal differentiation complex found on chromosome 1q21 and 75% of the genes required for de novo ceramide biosynthesis. Lipid analysis demonstrated that eight of the nine classes of ceramides were increased by TCDD, altering the ratio of ceramides to free fatty acids. TCDD decreased the expression of the glucose transporter, SLC2A1, and most of the glycolytic transcripts, followed by decreases in glycolytic intermediates, including pyruvate. NADH and Krebs cycle intermediates were decreased, whereas NAD(+) was increased. Mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) reductase activity and the GSH/glutathione disulfide ratio were decreased by TCDD, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased inner mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, and increased production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide.

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction results showed evidence of both non-crystalline and crystalline ordered hydrophobic regions in all the EW membranes except the 700 EW membrane. The spectral changes evident in the vibrational spectra of the 3M membranes can be associated with two major phenomena: (1) dissociation of the proton from the sulfonic acid groups even in the presence of small amounts of water; and (2) changes in the conformation or the degree of crystallinity of the poly(tetrafluoroethylene) hydrophobic domains both as a function of EW and membrane water content. All the membranes, regardless of EW, are thermally stable up to 360 \u00b0C. The wet membranes have conductivities between 7 and 20 mS/cm at 125 \u00b0C. In this condition, the conductivity values follow VTF behavior, which suggests that the proton migration occurs via proton exchange processes between delocalization bodies (DBs) that are facilitated by the dynamics of the host polymer. The conductivity along the interface between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains makes a larger contribution in the smaller EW membranes likely due to the existence of a greater number of interfaces in the membrane. The larger crystalline domains present in the higher EW membranes provide percolation pathways for charge migration between DBs, which reduces the probability of charge transfer along the interface.

Drug release followed zero-order and gave a good fit to the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, which suggested that drug release was due to diffusion through polymer swelling. Conclusion: Zero-order, controlled release profile with the desired buoyancy can be achieved by using optimum formula quantities of sodium bicarbonate and polymer.

Therefore, considering the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular diseases, this work aimed to assess the potential for an herb-drug interaction among a standardized F. vesiculosus extract (GMP certificate) and amiodarone (a narrow therapeutic index drug) in rats. In a first pharmacokinetic study, rats were simultaneously co-administered with a single-dose of F. vesiculosus (575 mg/kg, p.o.) and amiodarone (50 mg/kg, p.o.); in a second study, rats were pre-treated during 14 days with F. vesiculosus (575 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and received amiodarone (50 mg/kg, p.o.) on the 15th day. Rats of the control groups received the corresponding volume of vehicle. After analysis of the pharmacokinetic data it deserves to be highlighted the significant decrease in the peak plasma concentration of amiodarone (55.4%) as well as the reduction of systemic exposure to the parent drug (~30%) following the simultaneous co-administration of F. vesiculosus extract and amiodarone. This paper reports, for the first time, the herb-drug interaction between F. vesiculosus and amiodarone, which determined a considerable decrease on amiodarone bioavailability in rats. Therefore, the therapeutic efficacy of amiodarone may be compromised by the concurrent administration of herbal slimming medicines/dietary supplements containing F. vesiculosus.", "anno": [[74, 75, true], [348, 349, true], [667, 668, true], [740, 741, true], [1052, 1053, true], [1237, 1238, true], [1415, 1416, true]]}, {"id": 23201622, "text": "Gene therapy can be combined with tissue engineering constructs to produce gene-activated matrices (GAMs) with enhanced capacity for repair. Polyethyleneimine (PEI), a non-viral vector, has previously been optimised for high efficiency gene transfer in rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs). The use of PEI to transfect human MSCs (hMSCs) with ephrinB2 is assessed here. Recently a role for the ephrinB2 ligand and EphB4 receptor duo has been proposed in bone remodelling. Herein, over-expression of the ephrinB2 ligand resulted in increased osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs. As ephrinB2 is a cell surface anchored ligand which only interacts with cells expressing the cognate EphB4 receptor through direct contact, we have shown that direct cell-cell contact between two neighbouring cells is responsible for enhanced osteogenesis. In an effort to begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms at play downstream of ephrinB2 over-expression, RT-PCR was performed on the GAMs which revealed no significant changes in runx2 or BMP2 expression but an upregulation of osterix (Osx) and Dlx5 expression prompting the belief that the mode of osteogenesis is independent of the BMP2 pathway. This select interaction, coupled with the transient gene expression profile of PEI, makes the PEI-ephrinB2 GAM an ideal candidate matrix for a bone targeted GAM.", "anno": [[139, 140, true], [287, 288, true], [366, 367, true], [468, 469, true], [574, 575, true], [831, 832, true], [1182, 1183, true], [1344, 1345, true]]}]}
