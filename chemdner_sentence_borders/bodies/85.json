In addition, IHC analysis of human ovarian tumor tissue arrays indicated that GDF15 expression correlated significantly with high MMP2 and MMP9 expression. Exogenous and endogenous GDF15 over-expression stimulated phosphorylation of p38, Erk1/2, and Akt. Pharmacologic inhibition of p38, MEK, or PI3K suppressed GDF15-stimulated growth. Further, proliferation, growth, and invasion of GDF15 stable clones were blocked by rapamycin. IHC analysis demonstrated significant correlation between GDF15 expression and phosphorylation of mTOR. Finally, knockdown of endogenous GDF15 or neutralization of secreted GDF15 suppressed invasion and growth of a GDF15-over-expressing ovarian cancer cell line.

The prototypic redox-regulated targets downstream of ROS are the protein tyrosine phosphatases, and the wealth of research that has focused on this area has come to shape our understanding of how redox-signalling contributes to and facilitates protein tyrosine phosphorylation signalling cascades. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is more to this system than simply the negative regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Identification of redox-sensitive kinases such as Src led to the slow emergence of a role for redox regulation of tyrosine kinases. A flow of evidence, which has increased exponentially in recent times as a result of the development of new methods for the detection of oxidative modifications, demonstrates that, by concurrent oxidative activation of tyrosine kinases, ROS fine tune the duration and amplification of the phosphorylation signal.

OBJECTIVES: This study characterized the endocrine correlates during schedule-induced polydipsia of water and ethanol using a longitudinal approach in non-human primates. METHODS: Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were measured in samples from awake cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, 11 adult males) obtained at the onset, mid-day, and offset of their 12-h light cycle. The monkeys were induced to drink water and ethanol (4\u00a0%\u2009w/v, in water) using a fixed time (FT) 300-s interval schedule of pellet delivery. The induction fluid changed every 30 sessions in the following order: water, 0.5\u00a0g/kg ethanol, 1.0\u00a0g/kg ethanol, and 1.5\u00a0g/kg ethanol. Following induction, ethanol and water were concurrently available for 22\u00a0h/day. RESULTS: The FT 300-s schedule gradually increased ACTH, but not cortisol, during water induction to a plateau sustained throughout ethanol induction in every monkey. Upon termination of the schedule, ACTH decreased to baseline and cortisol below baseline. Diurnal ACTH and cortisol were unrelated to the dose of ethanol, but ACTH rhythm flattened at 0.5\u00a0g/kg/day and remained flattened.

In this study, we have demonstrated that fisetin prevents diet-induced obesity through regulation of the signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a central mediator of cellular growth, cellular proliferation and lipid biosynthesis. To evaluate whether fisetin regulates mTORC1 signaling, we investigated the phosphorylation and kinase activity of the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and mTORC1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Fisetin treatment of preadipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of S6K1 and mTORC1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To further our understanding of how fisetin negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation of S6K1, mTOR and Akt in fisetin-treated TSC2-knockdown cells. The results suggested that fisetin treatment inhibits mTORC1 activity in an Akt-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that adipocyte differentiation is dependent on mTORC1 activity. Fisetin treatment inhibited adipocyte differentiation, consistent with the negative effect of fisetin on mTOR. The inhibitory effect of fisetin on adipogenesis is dependent of mTOR activity, suggesting that fisetin inhibits adipogenesis and the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides during adipocyte differentiation by targeting mTORC1 signaling. Fisetin supplementation in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly attenuated HFD-induced increases in body weight and white adipose tissue. We also observed that fisetin efficiently suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt, S6K1 and mTORC1 in adipose tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by fisetin prevents adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and obesity in HFD-fed mice.

The activities of the naphthyridinols were assayed in phosphatidylcholine unilamellar liposomes using a recently developed high-throughput assay that employs a boron dipyrromethene conjugate of \u03b1-TOH (H(2)B-PMHC) that undergoes fluorescence enhancement upon oxidation. The naphthyridinols afforded a dose-dependent protection of H(2)B-PMHC consistent with unprecedented peroxyl radical-trapping activity in lipid bilayers. While sidechain length and/or branching had no effect on their apparent reactivity, it dramatically impacted reaction stoichiometry, with more lipophilic compounds trapping two peroxyl radicals and more hydrophilic compounds trapping significantly less than one. It is suggested that the less lipophilic compounds autoxidize rapidly in the aqueous phase and that preferential partitioning of the more lipophilic compounds to the bilayer protects them from autoxidation.

The method was applied to investigate the pharmacokinetics of four flavones in rat plasma after oral administration of Glycyrrhiza flavones. Chromatographic separation was accomplished on an Agilent TC-C18 column (4.6mm\u00d7250mm, 5\u03bcm), with gradient elution by using a mixture of methanoic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8mL/min. RESULTS: The calibration curves for four flavones had good linearity in the measured range with higher than 0.997. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the intra- and inter-day precision at different levels were all less than 4.8%.

The anti-tumor and anti-metastatic actions of wogonin may be associated with the inhibition of VEGF-C-induced lymphangiogenesis through a reduction in VEGF-C-induced VEGFR-3 phosphorylation by the inhibition of COX-2 expression and IL-1\u03b2 production in TAMs.", "anno": [[301, 302, true], [471, 472, true], [647, 648, true], [905, 906, true], [1060, 1061, true], [1256, 1257, true], [1514, 1515, true]]}, {"id": 23350530, "text": "PLGA nanoparticles are among the most studied polymer nanoformulations for several drugs against different kinds of malignant diseases, thanks to their in vivo stability and tumor localization exploiting the well-documented \"enhanced permeation and retention\" (EPR) effect. In this paper, we have developed uniform curcumin-bearing PLGA nanoparticles by a single-emulsion process, which exhibited a curcumin release following a Fickian-law diffusion over 10 days in vitro. PLGA nanoparticles were about 120 nm in size, as determined by dynamic light scattering, with a surface negative charge of -30 mV. The loading ratio of encapsulated drug in our PLGA nanoformulation was 8 wt%. PLGA encapsulation provided efficient protection of curcumin from environment, as determined by fluorescence emission experiments. Next, we have investigated the possibility to study the intracellular degradation of nanoparticles associated with a specific G2/M blocking effect on MCF7 breast cancer cells caused by curcumin release in the cytoplasm, which provided direct evidence on the mechanism of action of our nanocomplex. This study was carried out using Annexin V-based cell death analysis, MTT assessment of proliferation, flow cytometry, and confocal laser scanning microscopy.

Carbaryl exposure (5-20 mg L(-1)) for 48 h increased cortisol and glucose, but decreased the T(3) level without affecting T(4) concentration in the plasma. These responses of the carbaryl-exposed fish were nullified and a rise in plasma T(4) occurred in these fish when they were kept for 96 h recovery in clean water. A tight plasma mineral control was indicated in the carbaryl-exposed fish as reflected by the unchanged plasma Na, K, Ca and inorganic phosphate levels. The ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity showed an increase in the gills but the intestinal and renal tissues showed little response to carbaryl treatment. However, substantial increases in the intestinal and renal Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activities occurred in the recovery fish. The MR cells in the branchial epithelia showed a strong Na(+), K(+)-ATPase immunoreactivity to carbaryl treatment indicating an activated MR cell function. The numerical MR cell density remained unchanged, but stretching of secondary gill lamellae as part of gill remodeling occurred during carbaryl exposure. The increased surface of these lamellae with abundant MR cells as a result of its migration into the lamellar surface points to marked structural and functional modifications of these cells in the carbaryl-treated fish which is likely to a target for carbaryl action. The rise in plasma T(4) and the restoration of normal branchial epithelia in the recovery fish indicate a thyroidal involvement in the recovery response and survival. Our data thus provide evidence that carbaryl exposure and its recovery evoke interrenal and thyroid disruption in this fish leading to a modified osmotic response including an altered MR cell function.", "anno": [[292, 293, true], [448, 449, true], [611, 612, true], [764, 765, true], [929, 930, true], [1049, 1050, true], [1205, 1206, true], [1359, 1360, true], [1627, 1628, true], [1794, 1795, true], [1996, 1997, true]]}, {"id": 22999653, "text": "Loss of vision in glaucoma occurs because retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die.

From a focused library of >6,000 clinically used drug-like and pharmacologically active compounds, several classes of active compounds emerged, with a confirmed hit rate of <0.5%. Follow-up studies focused on paroxetine, a clinically used antidepressant compound that has not been previously implicated in the context of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Paroxetine reduced hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial ROS formation, mitochondrial protein oxidation, and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage, without interfering with mitochondrial electron transport or cellular bioenergetics. The ability of paroxetine to improve hyperglycemic endothelial cell injury was unique among serotonin reuptake blockers and can be attributed to its antioxidant effect, which primarily resides within its sesamol moiety. Paroxetine maintained the ability of vascular rings to respond to the endothelium-dependent relaxant acetylcholine, both during in vitro hyperglycemia and ex vivo, in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Thus, the current work identifies a novel pharmacological action of paroxetine as a protector of endothelial cells against hyperglycemic injury and raises the potential of repurposing of this drug for the experimental therapy of diabetic cardiovascular complications.", "anno": [[280, 281, true], [460, 461, true], [628, 629, true], [858, 859, true], [1078, 1079, true], [1293, 1294, true], [1561, 1562, true]]}, {"id": 23305503, "text": "Metformin has been shown to inhibit the growth of endometriotic implants, and reverse endometrial hyperplasia when combined with oral contraceptive in a case report.

Histological markers of uterotrophy, including endometrial height, luminal ephitelial cell height and density of endometrial glands on hysterectomy speciments were quantified for each specimen. Rats treated with estradiol had significantly increased in endometrial height, endomerial luminal epithelial height and endometrial gland densitiy than the other groups. Metformin and MPA acetate significantly reduced all parameters indicating endometrial hyperplasia, and uterotrophy with respect to the control group.

However, there is little known about neurotoxic injuries of CA on the mammalian, the toxic effects and molecular mechanisms of CA-induced neuronal cell injury are mostly unknown. In this study, we examined the cytotoxicity of CA on cultured Neuro-2a cells and investigated the possible mechanisms of CA-induced neurotoxicity. Treatment of Neuro-2a cells with CA significantly reduced the number of viable cells (in a dose-dependent manner with a range from 0.1 to 3mM), increased the generation of ROS, and reduced the intracellular levels of glutathione depletion. CA also increased the number of sub-G1 hypodiploid cells; increased mitochondrial dysfunction (loss of MMP, cytochrome c release, and accompanied by Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 down-regulation and Bax up-regulation), and activated the caspase cascades activations, which displayed features of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. These CA-induced apoptosis-related signals were markedly prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Moreover, CA activated the JNK and p38-MAPK pathways, but did not that ERK1/2 pathway, in treated Neuro-2a cells. Pretreatment with NAC and specific p38-MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), but not JNK inhibitor (SP600125) effectively abrogated the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and attenuated the apoptotic signals (including: decrease in cytotoxicity, caspase-3/-7 activation, the cytosolic cytochrome c release, and the reversed alteration of Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA) in CA-treated Neuro-2a cells.
