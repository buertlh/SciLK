Flow rheology measurements showed that the formulation composed of PPG-5-CETETH-20, oleic acid and water (55, 30, 15% w/w), denominated P, has Newtonian flow behavior. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) revealed that formulation P is isotropic, whereas its 1:1 (w/w) dilution with artificial nasal mucus (ANM) changed the system to an anisotropic lamellar phase (PD). Oscillatory frequency sweep analysis showed that PD has a high storage modulus (G') at nasal temperatures. Measurement of the mucoadhesive force against excised porcine nasal mucosa or a mucin disk proved that the transition to the lamellar phase tripled the work of mucoadhesion. Ex vivo permeation studies across porcine nasal mucosa exhibited an 18-fold rise in the permeability of AZT from the formulation. The Weibull mathematical model suggested that the AZT is released by Fickian diffusion mechanisms. Hence, the physicochemical characterization, combined with ex vivo studies, revealed that the PPG-5-CETETH-20, oleic acid, and water formulation could form a mucoadhesive matrix in contact with nasal mucus that promoted nasal absorption of the AZT. For an in vivo assessment, the plasma concentrations of AZT in rats were determined by HPLC method following intravenous and intranasal administration of AZT-loaded P formulation (PA) and AZT solution, respectively, at a dose of 8mg/kg. The intranasal administration of PA resulted in a fast absorption process (Tmax=6.7min).

Plants provide an extraordinary source of natural medicines for different diseases. Moreover, secondary metabolites of plant origin serve as an invaluable chemical library for drug discovery and current medicinal chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry. Over the past 25 years, 50% of prescription drugs have been developed from natural products and their derivatives. In this article, we review more than 20 plant compounds and extracts reported in the literature to prevent and treat type-1 diabetes. Emphasis is placed on their chemistry and biology in terms of regulation of immune cells and pancreatic \u03b2-cells. We summarize recent progress in understanding the biological actions, mechanisms and therapeutic potential of the compounds and extracts of plant origin in type 1 diabetes. New views on phytocompound-based strategies for prevention and treatment of type 1 diabetes are also discussed.", "anno": [[136, 137, true], [235, 236, true], [382, 383, true], [431, 432, true], [528, 529, true], [640, 641, true], [731, 732, true], [863, 864, true], [947, 948, true], [1118, 1119, true], [1233, 1234, true], [1367, 1368, true], [1480, 1481, true], [1653, 1654, true], [1765, 1766, true]]}, {"id": 23210788, "text": "Plants and plant cells have been used to produce many diverse and valuable recombinant proteins, including subunit vaccines, antibodies and antibody fragments, hormones, blood products, cytokines and enzymes.

Whole plants are suitable for the economical and safe production of recombinant proteins on a large scale, providing unique advantages for pharmaceutical proteins that are required in large amounts and normally too expensive for conventional manufacturing processes. Seed-based systems have additional advantages because they exploit the natural storage properties of seeds to facilitate batch processing and distribution.

Detailed characterization of the obtained brushes using static water contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and polarization-modulation reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy is presented. While sequential grafting of the two polymers for different reactions times did not give rise to a broad range of composition of mixed brushes, simultaneous grafting of the polymers from solutions with different compositions allows for the synthesis of a range of mixed brushes (mass fraction of PEO in the mixed brushes from 0.35 to 0.65). A key example is then chosen to illustrate the switchable behavior of a selected mixed PEO/PAA brush toward albumin adsorption. The adsorption behavior was monitored with a quartz crystal microbalance.

Here, we prove that hot spot dominated systems show little dependence on the far-field scattering properties because of differences between near- and far-field localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects as well as excitation of new plasmon modes via a localized emitter. We directly probe the relationship between the near- and far-field light interactions using a correlated LSPR-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) surface-enhanced Raman excitation spectroscopy (SERES) technique. Fourteen individual SERS nanoantennas, Au nanoparticle aggregates ranging from dimers to undecamers, coated in a reporter molecule and encased in a protective silica shell, were excited using eight laser wavelengths.

The magnitude of maximum EF was not correlated to the number of cores in the nanoantenna or the spectral position of the LSPR, suggesting a separation between near-field SERS enhancement and far-field Rayleigh scattering. Computational electrodynamics confirms the decoupling of maximum SERS enhancement from the peak of the scattering spectrum. It also points to the importance of a localized emitter for radiating Raman photons to the far-field which, in nonsymmetric systems, allows for the excitation of radiative plasmon modes that are difficult to excite with plane waves.

The predicted enthalpic barrier for this proton-coupled ET (PCET) reaction is 45.7 kcal/mol for direct PT from PyH(0) to CO(2). However, when PT is mediated by one to three water molecules acting as a proton relay, the barrier decreases to 29.5, 20.4, and 18.5 kcal/mol, respectively. The water proton relay reduces strain in the transition state (TS) and facilitates more complete ET. For PT mediated by a three water molecule proton relay, adding water molecules to explicitly solvate the core reaction system reduces the barrier to 13.6-16.5 kcal/mol, depending on the number and configuration of the solvating waters. This agrees with the experimentally determined barrier of 16.5 \u00b1 2.4 kcal/mol. We calculate a pK(a) for PyH(0) of 31 indicating that PT preceding ET is highly unfavorable. Moreover, we demonstrate that ET precedes PT in PyCOOH(0) formation, confirming PyH(0)'s pK(a) as irrelevant for predicting PT from PyH(0) to CO(2). Furthermore, we calculate adiabatic electron affinities in aqueous solvent for CO(2), Py, and Py\u00b7CO(2) of 47.4, 37.9, and 66.3 kcal/mol respectively, indicating that the anionic complex PyCOO(-) stabilizes the anionic radicals CO(2)(-) and Py(-) to facilitate low barrier ET.

Interestingly for \u223c40% (n = 6) of the samples with binary mixtures in the LB leaflet and a single component in the LS leaflet, that is, (DOPC/DPPC)(LB)+DOPC(LS), the contrast of the DPPC domains changed from the original dark (without dye) to bright (more TR dye partitioning) on TIRF images, returning to dark again. This contrast reverse was also correlated to AFM height images, where a DPPC-DPPC gel phase was spotted after the TIRF image contrast returned to dark. The rupture force mapping results measured on these binary mixture samples also confirmed unambiguously the formation of DPPC-DPPC gel domain components during the contrast change. The samples were tracked over 48 h to investigate the lipid molecule movements in both the DPPC domains and the DOPC fluid phase. The fluorescence contrast changes from bright to dark in SLBs indicate that the movement of dye molecules was independent of the movement of lipid molecules.

Thus, inhibition of NTE activity was not the culprit; rather, formation of an abnormal protein was the agent of the disorder. More recently, however, Paul Glynn and colleagues showed that whereas conventional knockout of the NTE gene was embryonic lethal, conditional knockout of central nervous system NTE produced neurodegeneration, suggesting to these authors that the absence of NTE rather than its presence in some altered form caused disease. We now know that NTE is the 6th member of a 9-protein family called patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing proteins, PNPLA1-9. Mutations in the catalytic domain of NTE (PNPLA6) are associated with a slowly developing disease akin to OP neuropathy and hereditary spastic paraplegia called NTE-related motor neuron disorder (NTE-MND). Furthermore, the NTE protein from affected individuals has altered enzymological characteristics. Moreover, closely related PNPLA7 is regulated by insulin and glucose. These seemingly disparate findings are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but we need to reconcile recent genetic findings with the historical body of toxicological data indicating that inhibition and aging of NTE are both necessary in order to produce neuropathy from exposure to certain OP compounds. Solving this mystery will be satisfying in itself, but it is also an enterprise likely to pay dividends by enhancing our understanding of the physiological and pathogenic roles of the PNPLA family of proteins in neurological health and disease, including a potential role for NTE in diabetic neuropathy.", "anno": [[199, 200, true], [341, 342, true], [481, 482, true], [607, 608, true], [930, 931, true], [1063, 1064, true], [1269, 1270, true], [1367, 1368, true], [1437, 1438, true], [1741, 1742, true], [2045, 2046, true]]}, {"id": 23220003, "text": "Previously, this laboratory had shown that fructose and its downstream metabolites can be enzymatically metabolized to form glyoxal and methylglyoxal.

The polyphenols were also investigated for their rescuing ability and were found to provide greater hepatoprotection when toxins were pre-incubated for 30 min before adding the polyphenols. However, rutin was less protective when rescuing hepatocytes, perhaps, because rutin metabolites may scavenge reactive oxygen species more effectively than rutin itself.

The enzymes of retinol oxidation are NAD-dependent dehydrogenases of the cytosolic medium-chain (MDR) and the membrane-bound short-chain (SDR) dehydrogenases/reductases. Retinaldehyde reduction can be performed by SDR and aldo-keto reductases (AKR), while its oxidation to RA is carried out by aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH). In contrast to SDR, AKR and ALDH are cytosolic. A common property of these enzymes is that they only use free retinoid, but not retinoid bound to cellular retinol binding protein (CRBP). The relative contribution of each enzyme type in retinoid metabolism is discussed in terms of the different subcellular localization, topology of membrane-bound enzymes, kinetic constants, binding affinity of CRBP for retinol and retinaldehyde, and partition of retinoid pools between membranes and cytoplasm. The development of selective inhibitors for AKR enzymes 1B1 and 1B10, of clinical relevance in diabetes and cancer, granted the investigation of some structure-activity relationships.

Oxidized lipid products released by free radical reaction (F(2)-isoprostanes and metabolites, F(3)-isoprostanes, neuroprostanes, 7-ketocholesterol, 7\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol), by lipoxygenase enzymes (5(S)-, 8(S)-, 12(S)- and 15(S)-HETE, and resolvin D1) and by cytochrome P450 (9(S)-, 11(S)- and 20-HETE, and 27-hydroxycholestrol) were measured in fish muscle using LC/MS/MS. Arachidonate, docosahexaenoate, eicosapentaenoate and cholesterol levels, and antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase, SOD and gluthathione reductase) measurement were also determined. Activity of antioxidant enzymes especially catalase were elevated in presence of H(2)O(2) however longer exposure time suppressed the antioxidant activities. Arachidonate, docosahexaenoate, eicosapentaenoate and cholesterol levels were reduced in presence of H(2)O(2) and oxidized lipid products (isoprostanes, neuroprostanes 5(S)-HETE, 20-HETE, 7-ketocholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol and resolvin D1) were rapidly released in the fish muscle.

Although calorie restriction and weight loss increase insulin sensitivity, the effects of modifying macronutrient composition on insulin sensitivity are uncertain.

The study participants were 164 individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension without diabetes. Diets were administered for 6 weeks each, with a washout period between diets of 2-4 weeks.

This study highlights that most of these insect dyes can be good photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells based on their strong binding to the TiO(2) surface, good computed excited state oxidation potential and thermodynamically favored electron driving force.", "anno": [[277, 278, true], [371, 372, true], [514, 515, true], [709, 710, true], [976, 977, true]]}, {"id": 23224942, "text": "To further understand the structure of graphene oxide, several structures of graphene oxide were systematically investigated using density functional theory (DFT). Our models consisted of a hexagonal in-plane structure of graphene with epoxy groups, and different oxidation levels. We found that different arrangements of these units yielded a range of vibrational spectra. Raman positions of the D and G bands depend sensitively on the local atomic configurations. Both structure energy and spectra computations indicate that the oxidation functional groups are energetically favorable to aggregate together and to be close to one another on the opposite side of graphene surface.", "anno": [[162, 163, true], [280, 281, true], [372, 373, true], [464, 465, true], [680, 681, true]]}, {"id": 23225075, "text": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal degenerative disorder of motor neurons. The cause of this degeneration is unknown, and different causal hypotheses include genetic, viral, traumatic and environmental mechanisms. In this study, we have analyzed metal concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma in a well-defined cohort (n = 17) of ALS patients diagnosed with quantitative electromyography. Metal analyses were performed with high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Statistically significant higher concentrations of manganese, aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, zinc, lead, vanadium and uranium were found in ALS CSF compared to control CSF. We also report higher concentrations of these metals in ALS CSF than in ALS blood plasma, which indicate mechanisms of accumulation, e.g. inward directed transport. A pattern of multiple toxic metals is seen in ALS CSF. The results support the hypothesis that metals with neurotoxic effects are involved in the pathogenesis of ALS.", "anno": [[101, 102, true], [240, 241, true], [435, 436, true], [532, 533, true], [710, 711, true], [875, 876, true], [930, 931, true], [1042, 1043, true]]}]}
