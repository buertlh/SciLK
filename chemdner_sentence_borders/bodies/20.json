We also examined whether experimentally induced increases in insulin by beta cell secretagogues, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), will decrease vagal control. METHODS: Respiration and ECGs were recorded for 130 healthy participants undergoing clamps. Three variables of cardiac vagal effects (the root mean square of successive differences [rMSSD] in the interbeat interval of the heart rate [IBI], heart-rate variability [HRV] caused by peak-valley respiratory sinus arrhythmia [pvRSA], and high-frequency power [HF]) and heart rate (HR) were obtained at seven time points during the clamps, characterised by increasing levels of insulin (achieved by administering insulin plus glucose, glucose only, glucose and GLP-1, and glucose and GLP-1 combined with arginine). RESULTS: Serum insulin level was positively associated with HR at all time points during the clamps except the first-phase hyperglycaemic clamp. Insulin levels were negatively correlated with variables of vagal control, reaching significance for rMSSD and log(10)HF, but not for pvRSA, during the last four phases of the hyperglycaemic clamp (hyperglycaemic second phase, GLP-1 first and second phases, and arginine). These associations disappeared when adjusted for age, BMI and insulin sensitivity. Administration of the beta cell secretagogues GLP-1 and arginine led to a significant increase in HR, but this was not paired with a significant reduction in HRV measures. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Experimentally induced hyperinsulinaemia is not correlated with cardiac vagal control or HR when adjusting for age, BMI and insulin sensitivity index. Our findings suggest that exposure to a GLP-1 during hyperglycaemia leads to a small acute increase in HR but not to an acute decrease in cardiac vagal control.", "anno": [[15, 16, true], [197, 198, true], [366, 367, true], [375, 376, true], [458, 459, true], [975, 976, true], [984, 985, true], [1120, 1121, true], [1393, 1394, true], [1476, 1477, true], [1648, 1649, true], [1675, 1676, true], [1826, 1827, true], [1987, 1988, true]]}, {"id": 23404458, "text": "Trace elements (TEs) may contribute to the formation of calculi or stones or be involved in the aetiopathogenesis of stone diseases.

This study aimed to use the hyperspectral imaging technique as a non-destructive tool for quantitative and direct determination of Enterobacteriaceae loads on chicken fillets. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were established and the best model using full wavelengths was obtained in the spectral range 930-1450 nm with coefficients of determination R(2)\u2265 0.82 and root mean squared errors (RMSEs) \u2264 0.47 log(10)CFUg(-1). In further development of simplified models, second derivative spectra and weighted PLS regression coefficients (BW) were utilised to select important wavelengths. However, the three wavelengths (930, 1121 and 1345 nm) selected from BW were competent and more preferred for predicting Enterobacteriaceae loads with R(2) of 0.89, 0.86 and 0.87 and RMSEs of 0.33, 0.40 and 0.45 log(10)CFUg(-1) for calibration, cross-validation and prediction, respectively. Besides, the constructed prediction map provided the distribution of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria on chicken fillets, which cannot be achieved by conventional methods. It was demonstrated that hyperspectral imaging is a potential tool for determining food sanitation and detecting bacterial pathogens on food matrix without using complicated laboratory regimes.", "anno": [[79, 80, true], [255, 256, true], [515, 516, true], [679, 680, true], [971, 972, true], [1138, 1139, true], [1332, 1333, true]]}, {"id": 23411334, "text": "A cyclic voltammetry (CV) study was performed in pH 5.5 Britton-Robinson buffer at room temperature to study the stability of 1mM l-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (l-5-MTHF) in combination with epigallocatechin-gallate-enriched extract (EGCGe) and epigallocatechin-enriched extract (EGCe). The combination of l-5-MTHF with enriched catechin extracts provided enhanced stability of l-5-MTHF over a period of 12h under ambient air conditions at pH 5.5.

In this study, we used a three-way full factorial design to investigate whether interactive effects between a natural stressor, the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa, and a chemical stressor, the insecticide carbaryl, were different between two genetically distinct clones of Daphnia magna that strongly differ in their sensitivity to carbaryl.

No interactions were found for maturation rate, filtration rate, and energy reserve fractions (carbohydrate, protein, lipid).

Placebo or canagliflozin 300 mg was given 20 min before a 600-kcal mixed-meal tolerance test. Plasma glucose, (3)H-glucose, (14)C-glucose, and insulin were measured frequently for 6 h to calculate rates of appearance of oral glucose (R(a)O) in plasma, endogenous glucose production, and glucose disposal.RESULTSCompared with placebo, canagliflozin treatment reduced postprandial plasma glucose and insulin excursions (incremental 0- to 2-h area under the curve [AUC(0-2h)] reductions of 35% and 43%, respectively; P < 0.001 for both), increased 0- to 6-h urinary glucose excretion (UGE(0-6h), 18.2 \u00b1 5.6 vs <0.2 g; P < 0.001), and delayed R(a)O.

This functional CB(1) receptor tolerance poses a hurdle in the development of MAGL inhibitors for therapeutic use. Consequently, the present study tested whether repeated administration of low dose JZL184 maintains its antinociceptive actions in the chronic constrictive injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve neuropathic pain model and protective effects in a model of NSAlD-induced gastric hemorrhages. Mice given daily injections of high dose JZL184 (\u226516 mg/kg) for six days displayed decreased CB(1) receptor density and function in brain, as assessed in [(3)H]SR141716A binding and CP55,940-stimulated [(35)S]GTP\u03b3S binding assays, respectively. In contrast, normal CB(1) receptor expression and function were maintained following repeated administration of low dose JZL184 (\u22648 mg/kg). Likewise, the antinociceptive and gastroprotective effects of high dose JZL184 underwent tolerance following repeated administration, but these effects were maintained following repeated low dose JZL184 treatment. Consistent with these observations, repeated high dose JZL184, but not repeated low dose JZL184, elicited cross-tolerance to the common pharmacological effects of \u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
