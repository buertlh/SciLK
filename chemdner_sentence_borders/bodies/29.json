However, most breast tumors are eventually resistant to tamoxifen therapy. The molecular mechanisms underlying tamoxifen resistance have not been well established. Recently, we reported that breast cancer patients with tumors expressing high concentrations of ER-\u03b136, a variant of ER-\u03b1, benefited less from tamoxifen therapy than those with low concentrations of ER-\u03b136, suggesting that increased ER-\u03b136 concentration is one of the underlying mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance. Here, we investigated the function and underlying mechanism of ER-\u03b136 in tamoxifen resistance. We found that tamoxifen increased ER-\u03b136 concentrations and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells expressed high concentrations of ER-\u03b136. In addition, MCF7 cells with forced expression of recombinant ER-\u03b136 and H3396 cells expressing high concentrations of endogenous ER-\u03b136 were resistant to tamoxifen. ER-\u03b136 downregulation in tamoxifen-resistant cells with the shRNA method restored tamoxifen sensitivity. We also found tamoxifen acted as a potent agonist by activating phosphorylation of the AKT kinase in ER-\u03b136 expressing cells. Finally, we found that cells with high concentration of ER-\u03b136 protein were hypersensitive to estrogen; activating ERK phosphorylation at pM range. Our results thus demonstrated that elevated ER-\u03b136 concentration is one of the mechanisms by which ER-positive breast cancer cells escape tamoxifen therapy and provided a rational to develop novel therapeutic approaches for tamoxifen resistant patients by targeting ER-\u03b136.", "anno": [[118, 119, true], [193, 194, true], [282, 283, true], [597, 598, true], [692, 693, true], [824, 825, true], [990, 991, true], [1095, 1096, true], [1221, 1222, true], [1369, 1370, true], [1643, 1644, true]]}, {"id": 23546605, "text": "Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), a major product of testicular Leydig cells, is also expressed by the ovary, but its functional role remains poorly understood. Here, we quantified expression of INSL3 and its receptor RXFP2 in theca interna cell (TIC) and granulosa cell compartments of developing bovine antral follicles and in corpora lutea (CL). INSL3 and RXFP2 mRNA levels were much higher in TIC than granulosa cell and increased progressively during follicle maturation with INSL3 peaking in large (11-18 mm) estrogen-active follicles and RXFP2 peaking in 9- to 10-mm follicles before declining in larger (11-18 mm) follicles. Expression of both INSL3 and RXFP2 in CL was much lower than in TIC. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed abundant expression of INSL3 mRNA and protein in TIC. These observations indicate follicular TIC rather than CL as the primary site of both INSL3 production and action, implying a predominantly autocrine/paracrine role in TIC. To corroborate the above findings, we showed that in vitro exposure of TIC to a luteinizing concentration of LH greatly attenuated expression of both INSL3 and its receptor while increasing progesterone secretion and expression of STAR and CYP11A1. Moreover, in vivo, a significant cyclic variation in plasma INSL3 was observed during synchronized estrous cycles. INSL3 and estradiol-17\u03b2 followed a similar pattern, both increasing after luteolysis, before falling sharply after the LH surge. Thus, theca-derived INSL3, likely from the dominant preovulatory follicle, is detectable in peripheral blood of cattle, and expression is down-regulated during luteinization induced by the preovulatory LH surge.

Among the IR-responsive miRNAs, we further examined the function of miR-193a-3p, which exhibited the most significant growth-inhibiting effect. miR-193a-3p was observed to induce apoptosis in both U-251 and HeLa cells.

We previously demonstrated that Entamoeba histolytica (E.h.) secretes a protease capable of dissolving this layer that is required for parasite penetration. Here, we asked if there are bacteria that can secrete similar proteases. We screened bacterial culture supernatants for such activity using recombinant fragments of the MUC2 mucin, the major structural component and the only gel-forming mucin in the colonic mucus. MUC2 has two central heavily O-glycosylated mucin domains that are protease-resistant and has cysteine rich N- and C-termini responsible for polymerization. Culture supernatants of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.), a bacterium that secretes proteases responsible for periodontitis, cleaved the MUC2-C terminal region, whereas the N-terminal region was unaffected. The active enzyme was isolated and identified as Arg-gingipain B (RgpB). Two cleavage sites were localized to IR\u2193TT and NR\u2193QA. IR\u2193TT cleavage will disrupt the MUC2 polymers. As this site has two potential O-glycosylation sites we tested whether recombinant GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts) could glycosylate a synthetic peptide covering the IRTT sequence. Only GalNAc-T3 was able to glycosylate the second Thr in IRTT, rendering the sequence resistant to cleavage by RgpB. Furthermore, when GalNAc-T3 was expressed in CHO-cells expressing the MUC2 C-terminal, the second threonine was glycosylated and the protein became resistant to RgpB cleavage.

However, our calculations, which take into account different ice surface models, suggest that there is another product with a higher formation probability ((3.00 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10(-2)), which is the HOCO complex, whereas the formation of CO2 has a probability of only (3.6 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10(-4). The initial location of the CO is key to obtain reaction and form CO2: the CO needs to be located deep into the ice. The HOCO complex becomes trapped in the cold ice surface in the trans-HOCO minimum because it quickly loses its internal energy to the surrounding ice, preventing further reaction to H + CO2. Several laboratory experiments have been carried out recently, and they confirm that CO2 can also be formed through other, different routes. Here we compare our theoretical results with the data available from experiments studying the formation of CO2 through a similar pathway as ours, even though the initial conditions were not exactly the same.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: When the PK profiles were different between subjects, the IDCs are dramatically different from each other and from the IDC for an \"average\" patient representing the patient population. The dose amount and dosing interval must be adjusted to maximize the probability of staying within the target concentration range. An optimal sampling methodology based on the assumption-free Bayesian approach is used to distinguish the PK profile of an individual patient from the patient population. In the case of gabapentin, only two optimally selected test blood samples, at 1.5 and 6\u00a0hours after administration of a single doses, were necessary. The average sensitivity and the average specificity of the OSS was 99% and 96%, respectively. CONCLUSION: IDCs display the risk of a patient violating the target concentration range for any dosage regimen. They can be used as a clinical-bedside decision-support tool in a patient-physician partnership to decide on a dose amount and dosing interval that are medically acceptable while practical and convenient to ensure compliance. By using the assumption-free Bayesian approach and the OSS, the number of samples required from a new patient to individualize the dosage regimen can be reduced significantly while preserving high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Prospective studies are being planned to validate the encouraging results. This approach can be extended to any drug if PK data and a target concentration range are available for either therapeutic drug monitoring or target concentration intervention.", "anno": [[15, 16, true], [380, 381, true], [447, 448, true], [455, 456, true], [553, 554, true], [563, 564, true], [889, 890, true], [920, 921, true], [1105, 1106, true], [1236, 1237, true], [1407, 1408, true], [1557, 1558, true], [1651, 1652, true], [1663, 1664, true], [1763, 1764, true], [1989, 1990, true], [2225, 2226, true], [2300, 2301, true], [2477, 2478, true]]}, {"id": 23553708, "text": "The favorable effects of short-term use of sildenafil on patients with Eisenmenger syndrome have been reported.

So far, only a small number of such dimeric complexes are known. Here, we present an algorithm for predicting cell-type-specific TF-TF dimerization on DNA on a large scale, using DNase I hypersensitivity data from 78 human cell lines. We represented the universe of possible TF complexes by their corresponding motif complexes, and analyzed their occurrence at cell-type-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites. Based on ~1.4 billion tests for motif complex enrichment, we predicted 603 highly significant cell-type-specific TF dimers, the vast majority of which are novel. Our predictions included 76% (19/25) of the known dimeric complexes and showed significant overlap with an experimental database of protein-protein interactions. They were also independently supported by evolutionary conservation, as well as quantitative variation in DNase I digestion patterns. Notably, the known and predicted TF dimers were almost always highly compact and rigidly spaced, suggesting that TFs dimerize in close proximity to their partners, which results in strict constraints on the structure of the DNA-bound complex. Overall, our results indicate that chromatin openness profiles are highly predictive of cell-type-specific TF-TF interactions.

The energy levels of 3^1 and 4^1 upper states of nitric acid are strongly interacting with those of the 9^3, 6^2, 5^19^1 and 7^18^1 dark states centered at 1288.899, 1289.46, 1341.05 and 1343.78 cm-1, respectively. Informations on these perturbing dark states were achieved through previous partial investigations of hot bands in high resolution Fourier transform spectra recorded at 22 \u00b5m in Giessen (for 3nu9-2nu9 and 3nu9-nu5), at 12 \u00b5m in Denver (for 3nu9-nu9), and at 11 \u00b5m in Orsay (for nu5+nu9-nu9).

For nitric acid the nu9 mode (OH torsion relative to the -NO2 moiety) is a large amplitude motion.

METHOD: Ninety-three participants, allocated according to a drink (glucose, placebo) \u00d7 message (told glucose, told nothing, told placebo) unrelated design, were administered tasks assessing immediate and delayed verbal free recall, spatial recognition and semantic verification. Each task has some evidence for hippocampus involvement, and variations in task difficulty were used to assess the idea that glucose effects are sensitive to task difficulty. RESULTS: While the messages biased drink judgements in the expected direction, judgements of drink content were at chance and glucose only enhanced delayed free recall. The subtle effects of the messages did not modify the glucose enhancement. However, believing glucose had been consumed showed an independent improvement in delayed free recall. There was no evidence that task complexity enhanced the glucose effect.

One prominent fragmentation pathway in the ESI-MS(3) of these adduct ions involves the loss of a fatty acid from the sn-1/3 position in the first step followed by the loss of an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated fatty acid from the sn-2 position in the second. Regioisomeric TAGs of the type ABA and AAB produced abundant product ions - [ABA+Li-RACOOH-R'BCHCHCOOH](+) and [AAB+Li-RACOOH-R'ACHCHCOOH](+) - the relative intensities of which were dependent on the position of acyl substituents. Standard solutions of TAGs containing different ratios of the regioisomeric pairs MME/MEM, PPE/PEP, PPD/PDP, EEP/EPE and DDP/DPD (M=14:0, P=16:0, E=20:5, D=22:6) were analysed by ESI-MS(3) with a quadrupole linear ion trap instrument. Methodology developed on the standards was applied to quantifying the relative isomeric abundances of EPA and DHA in several fish oil samples. DHA was preferentially located at the sn-2 position in both DHA-containing TAGs studied, while EPA was either observed at near equal levels in all positions, or predominantly at the sn-1 and -3 positions in some cases. The analysis protocol allows for quantification of the designated regioisomers in one simple, rapid chromatographic procedure using a single column and has the advantage of specificity over other methods for the positional analysis of TAGs, since it eliminates interferences associated with co-eluting TAGs of the same molecular weight that yield isobaric diacylglycerol-like product ions.", "anno": [[393, 394, true], [636, 637, true], [867, 868, true], [1102, 1103, true], [1245, 1246, true], [1464, 1465, true], [1854, 1855, true]]}, {"id": 23561161, "text": "The effects of different calcium salts on in vitro lipid digestion were examined by determining the free fatty acids released from various oil-in-water emulsions.

The rate and the extent of free fatty acid release increased with an increase in the added calcium concentration, but the increase was dependent on the emulsifying agent. The effect of calcium was diminished when the emulsion contained phosphate. Soluble calcium salts, such as calcium gluconate, calcium acetate and CaCl2, had greater effects on the rate and extent of free fatty acid release than did insoluble salts, such as CaO and CaSO4, suggesting that the ionic state of calcium plays a critical role in lipid digestion in emulsions.

For this, the folates contents were monitored along an industrial canning chain of green beans and along an industrial freezing chain of spinach. Folates contents decreased significantly by 25% during the washing step for spinach in the freezing process, and by 30% in the green beans canning process after sterilisation, with 20% of the initial amount being transferred into the covering liquid.
