The present study investigated drugs with affinity for one or more of the monoamine reuptake transporters using the 5-choice serial reaction time task, a model of attention and impulsivity in rodents. We also tested the effects of the alpha(2)-adreoceptor antagonist, idazoxan and novel antidepressant, agomelatine, which both increase cortical noradrenaline concentrations through non-reuptake mechanisms. Improvements in impulse control were observed with venlafaxine, a serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor (SNRI) but not bupropion (dopamine and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor). Sibutramine (SNRI) reduced premature responses by ~50% at the highest dose tested but this was not significant. All three of the SSRIs tested reduced premature responding in a dose-dependent manner, although also slowed response and collection latencies. Neither idazoxan nor agomelatine significantly reduced premature responding, suggesting a lack of efficacy at the doses tested. None of the drugs tested improved attention in this task but sibutramine (SNRI), fluoxetine (SSRI) and paroxetine (SSRI) all increased omissions at the highest dose tested.

Eugenol inhibits the virulence factors produced by P. mirabilis as observed by swimming motility, swarming behavior and urease activity.

Previous studies demonstrate that the activity of the evolutionarily conserved NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 declines with age and that pharmacological activators of SIRT1 confer significant anti-aging cardiovascular effects. To determine whether dysregulation of SIRT1 promotes NADPH oxidase-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairs endothelial function we assessed the effects of three structurally different inhibitors of SIRT1 (nicotinamide, sirtinol, EX527) in aorta segments isolated from young Wistar rats. Inhibition of SIRT1 induced endothelial dysfunction, as shown by the significantly reduced relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore A23187. Endothelial dysfunction induced by SIRT1 inhibition was prevented by treatment of the vessels with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin or superoxide dismutase. Inhibition of SIRT1 significantly increased vascular superoxide production, enhanced NADPH oxidase activity, and mRNA expression of its subunits p22(phox) and NOX4, which were prevented by resveratrol. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) activation mimicked the effects of resveratrol while PPAR\u03b1 inhibition prevented the effects of this SIRT1 activator. SIRT1 co-precipitated with PPAR\u03b1 and nicotinamide increased the acetylation of the PPAR\u03b1 coactivator PGC-1\u03b1, which was suppressed by resveratrol. In conclusion, impaired activity of SIRT1 induces endothelial dysfunction and up-regulates NADPH oxidase-derived ROS production in the vascular wall, mimicking the vascular aging phenotype.

Nanosuspensions released from implanted osmotic devices can be a strategy to overcome this challenge but little is known about their pharmacokinetic behavior after subcutaneous application. In the current study, four different nanosuspension formulations containing iodinated fenofibrate were prepared, physicochemically characterized and investigated concerning their in-vitro release kinetics from osmotic pumps. One nanosuspension of lower viscosity exhibited thereby an unexpectedly first order release kinetics, whereas the higher viscous counterpart was released in the expected zero-order manner. To assess the relation of the in-vitro release kinetics to the in-vivo fate of nanosuspensions, various [(131)I] iodinated fenofibrate formulations were subcutaneously applied to mice. The biodistribution was followed by means of \u03b3-scintigraphy and \u03b3-scintillation. Two different nanosuspensions released from osmotic pumps were compared to bolus injections of a nanosuspension and an organic drug solution. The distribution and elimination of the bolus injected drug solution were almost completed within 48h. In contrast, a long lasting (>1week) depot at the injection site was formed by the bolus injected nanosuspension. Ex vivo examination of the organs showed a sustained, but exponential decrease of the radiolabel concentration. More constant drug levels in the organs were achieved within the nanosuspensions released from osmotic pumps. The organ levels of [(131)I] labeled fenofibrate were found to be more constant in case of the pump with the higher viscous nanosuspension in contrast to the lower viscous counterpart. However, the very different release profiles of the lower and higher viscous nanosuspension observed in-vitro were not observed in-vivo, as both pumps showed zero order release. In conclusion, nanosuspensions of poorly soluble compounds released from subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps can be a suitable approach in pharmacokinetic studies. Although the in-vivo release of nanosuspensions differed in the expected release profile from the in-vitro test results, these in-vitro release tests present a valuable tool for the pre-selection of suitable nanosuspension candidates.", "anno": [[233, 234, true], [423, 424, true], [648, 649, true], [837, 838, true], [1022, 1023, true], [1103, 1104, true], [1245, 1246, true], [1348, 1349, true], [1462, 1463, true], [1574, 1575, true], [1684, 1685, true], [1869, 1870, true], [2047, 2048, true], [2214, 2215, true], [2449, 2450, true]]}, {"id": 22847135, "text": "Cervical cancer is the second most common female cancer worldwide, and it remains a challenge to manage preinvasive and invasive lesions.

Viability of SiHa cells was evaluated by the MTT assay, apoptosis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential by flow cytometry, and pro-apoptotic related genes by Real-time quantitative PCR. Naringin showed a 50% inhibition of SiHa human cervical cancer cells at a concentration of 750\u03bcM.

We examined over 30 molecules as potential zeolite growth modifiers (ZGMs) of zeolite L (LTL type) crystallization. ZGM efficacy was quantified through a combination of macroscopic (bulk) and microscopic (surface) investigations that identified modifiers capable of dramatically altering the cylindrical morphology of LTL crystals.

We report that a synergistic combination of ZGMs and the judicious adjustment of synthesis parameters produce LTL crystals with unique surface features, and a range of length-to-diameter aspect ratios spanning 3 orders of magnitude.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To perform a comparative analysis of the qualitative composition of secondary metabolites and biological activities of the leaves of the most commonly distributed and used Spanish Helianthemum taxa in order to find a relationship between chemotype, biological activity and uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: water and 80% methanolic extracts derived from 11 different Helianthemum taxa were analyzed for their phytochemical composition using standard methods. Furthermore, HPLC analysis was performed for the estimation of gallic acid, ellagic acid, tannins and flavonols as marker compounds. The antioxidant activity was measured by employing the scavenging activity on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radicals. The 80% methanolic extracts were evaluated for antibacterial (Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes and Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) activity using the micro dilution technique. RESULTS: The total polyphenolic content and antioxidant capabilities differed significantly among the Helianthemum leaf extracts. A strong correlation between total phenolic content, antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity was found. The polyphenolic profile was specific for each taxon. Whereas Helianthemum alypoides, Helianthemum cinereum subsp. rotundifolium, Helianthemum hirtum, Helianthemum asperum, and Helianthemum marifolium subsp. marifolium were characterized by the presence of gallic acid, egallic derivatives and ellagitannins; the polyphenolic profile of Helianthemum apenninum subsp. cavanillesianum, Helianthemum syriacum and Helianthemum polygonoides was mostly based on flavonoids. Helianthemum cinereum, Helianthemum alypoides and Helianthemum marifolium consistently presented the strongest radical scavenging activity (in water extracts EC50 ranges from 29.88 to 38.1 against DPPH and from 8.11 to 20.8 against ABTS, and in 80% MeOH extracts from 25.3 to 31.8 against DPPH and from 6.15 to 8.6 against ABTS), total phenol content (>117mg GAE/l) and antimicrobial activities.

Detailed analysis of SIC peak shapes for lysozyme shows that non-Gaussian peaks are commonly encountered for SIC, with typical peak asymmetries of 10%.

Therefore, it is important to use the centre of mass calculations for determining accurate retention volumes and thus B22 values. Empirical peak maximum chromatogram analysis, often reported in the literature, can result in errors of up to 50% in B22 values. A methodology is reported here for determining both the mean and the variance in B22 from SIC experiments, includes a correction for normal longitudinal peak broadening.
