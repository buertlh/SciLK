One of the first studies of RCD to include molecular genetic data was described 40\u00a0years ago in a complex of Haitian trunk anole lizards using a small number of allozyme loci. In this example, Anolis caudalis appears to experience divergence in the color and pattern of an extensible throat fan, or dewlap, in areas of contact with closely related species at the northern and southern limits of its range. However, this case study has been largely overlooked for decades; meanwhile, explanations for geographic variation in dewlap color and pattern have focused primarily on adaptation to local signalling environments. We reinvestigate this example using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genome scans, mtDNA sequence data, information on dewlap phenotypes and GIS data on environmental variation to test the hypothesis of RCD generated by reinforcement in Haitian trunk anoles. Together, our phenotypic and genetic results are consistent with RCD at the southern and northern limits of the range of A.\u00a0caudalis.

Arisaema lobatum is used to treat malaria, intestinal parasites, and snake and insect bites in humans and animals. The aim of this study was to determine the composition of the essential oils from Arisaema franchetianum and Arisaema lobatum and evaluate the anthelmintic effect against Haemonchus contortus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two oils were investigated by GC and GC-MS. The anthelmintic bioassay tests of Arisaema franchetianum and Arisaema lobatum essential oil, linalool and carvacrol were performed using egg hatch assay (EHA), larval development assay (LDA) and larval migration inhibition assay (LMIA). RESULTS: Fifty six components representing 96.88% of the Arisaema franchetianum oil and 64 components representing 96.88% of the Arisaema lobatum oil were identified. Carvacrol and linalool were found to be the major constituents of two oils. In the EHA, greater than 99% inhibition were observed with Arisaema franchetianum oil at 10mg/mL (CE50 1.63mg/mL) and Arisaema lobatum oil at 5 and 10mg/mL (CE50 0.48mg/mL). In the LDA, both oils induced complete inhibition at 10mg/mL, with the CE50 being 1.10mg/mL for Arisaema franchetianum oil and 0.73mg/mL for Arisaema lobatum oil. In the LMIA, the Arisaema franchetianum oil and Arisaema lobatum oil at best inhibited 74.1% and 95.6% of larval migration at 10mg/mL, respectively. Carvacrol exhibited similar activity to Arisaema lobatum essential oil and linalool did not show high activity in every assay.

The hysteresis of the pressure-area isotherm was much larger for asphaltenes than for bitumen. In both compression and expansion cycles, BAM images for bitumen films appeared to be more reproducible than those of the asphaltene films at the same surface pressures. Films for low-\u00b0API SAGD bitumen were almost identical to those for surface-mined bitumen.

Inhibition of TrkB tyrosine kinase signaling with k252a, or with the selective BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc, both inhibited MF-LTP to the same extent as observed in BDNF+/- mice. Basal synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity, and synaptic fatigue during LTP induction were not significantly altered by treatment with k252a or TrkB-Fc, or by chronic BDNF reduction in BDNF+/- mice. Since the acute interference with BDNF-signaling did not completely block MF-LTP, our results provide evidence that an additional mechanism besides BDNF induced TrkB signaling contributes to this type of LTP.

Methods The acetic acid-induced writhing test and the paw-licking test, in which paw licking was induced by glutamate and formalin, were performed to evaluate the antinociceptive action of CAT and to determine the involvement of PKC, PKA, TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPM8 and ASIC in its antinociceptive mechanism. To do so, we induced paw-linking using agonists. Results CAT was administered intragastrically (25, 50, 75, 100 and 200mg/kg), and the two higher doses caused antinociceptive effects in the acetic acid model; the highest dose reduced pain for 4h after it was administered (200mg/kg). In the formalin test, two doses of CAT promoted antinociception in both the early and later phases of the test. The glutamate test showed that its receptors are involved in the antinociceptive mechanism of CAT. Pretreatment with CAT did not alter locomotor activity or motor coordination. In an investigation into the participation of TRP channels and ASICs in CAT's antinociceptive mechanism, we used capsaicin (2.2\u03bcg/paw), cinnamaldehyde (10mmol/paw), menthol (1.2mmol/paw) and acidified saline (2% acetic acid, pH 1.98).

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether quetiapine would prevent and/or reverse stress-induced cognitive impairments in a rat model of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent attentional set-shifting task (ASST). Because quetiapine augmentation to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has recently been proven to be beneficial in neuropsychiatric disorders, a separate experiment was designed to assess the impact of combined administration of inactive doses of quetiapine and escitalopram on ASST performance in rats. According to our previous studies, 1 h daily exposure to restraint stress for 7 days significantly and specifically impaired extra-dimensional (ED) set-shifting ability of rats. Quetiapine (2.5 mg/kg, PO) given to rats prior to the restraint sessions completely prevented this stress-induced cognitive inflexibility. Similar effect was demonstrated after pretreatment with the \u03b11-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (1 mg/kg, IP). Moreover, acute administration of quetiapine before the test reversed set-shifting deficits in stressed rats (0.63, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, PO) and improved ED performance of cognitively unimpaired control animals (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, PO). Finally, the combined administration of inactive doses of quetiapine (0.63 and 0.3 mg/kg in control and stressed rats, respectively) and escitalopram (0.3 mg/kg, IP) facilitated set-shifting performance in either control or stressed rats. In conclusion, quetiapine administration either prevented or reversed stress-induced cognitive inflexibility in rats. In addition to promoting of set-shifting by itself, quetiapine also enhanced the procognitive efficacy of escitalopram. The potential contribution of the antagonism at \u03b11-adrenoceptors to the mechanisms underlying the protective action of quetiapine requires further evaluation.

To investigate these questions, we quantified variation on a fine geographical scale analysing morphological (shell) and genetic data sets coupled with environmental data in the land snail Murella muralis, endemic to the Mediterranean island of Sicily. Analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) and eight nuclear microsatellite loci showed that genetic variation is highly structured at a very fine spatial scale by local palaeogeographical events and historical population dynamics. Molecular clock estimates, calibrated here specifically for Tyrrhenian land snails, provided a framework of palaeogeographical events responsible for the observed geographical variations and migration routes. Finally, we showed for the first time well-documented lines of evidence of selection in the past, which explains divergence of land snail shell shapes.

We found that morin completely suppressed inducible and constitutively activated STAT3 and blocked the nuclear translocation of STAT3 and its DNA binding in multiple myeloma and head and neck squamous carcinoma cells. Morin inhibited activated Src, JAK-1, and JAK-2, all of which are linked to STAT3 activation, while up-regulating a protein inhibitor of activated STAT3, PIAS3. Pervanadate reversed the effects of morin on STAT3 phosphorylation, indicating the role of a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Furthermore, morin induced SHP1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, and silencing of SHP1 abrogated the effect of morin on STAT3 phosphorylation, indicating that morin mediates its effects on STAT3 through SHP1. Suppression of STAT3 correlated with the down-regulation of various gene products linked to tumor survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis and led to sensitization of tumor cells to thalidomide and bortezomib. Comparing the activities of morin with those of four structurally related flavonols demonstrated the importance of hydroxyl groups in the B ring in inhibiting STAT3 activation.

In the present work, we examined T248, Y249 and T422 putative phosphorylation sites determined based on in silico consensus kinase site prediction analysis. T248 and T422 residues are critical for the interaction of the PXR ligand-binding domain and the activation function-2 (AF2) domain.

We examined transactivation activity of the PXR mutants in gene reporter assays, formation of PXRmutant/RXR\u03b1 heterodimer, binding of PXR mutants to the CYP3A4 gene response element DR3 and CYP3A4 expression in HepG2 cells after expression of the mutants. We found that T248D mutant activated CYP3A4 transactivation constitutively regardless of the presence or absence of a ligand. Contrary, T248V mutant exhibited low basal and ligand-inducible transactivation capacity as compared to wild-type PXR.

However, even with these approaches showing promise, a major drawback is the activation of prohaptens, i.e. molecules needing a metabolic activation to become reactive and therefore sensitizing. Recently, it has been proposed to couple an enzymatic activation step based on horseradish peroxidase (HRP)/hydrogen peroxide to such peptide reactivity assays. To evaluate this approach, the behavior of 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (2M4MP), reported as a moderate sensitizer according to the Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA), has been investigated in this assay. To follow the reaction with the peptides and characterize more easily intermediates and adducts, the molecule was first (13)C isotopically substituted at the most probable reactive position. When 2M4MP was incubated with HRP/H2O2 in a mixture PBS (pH 7.4, 0.1M)/acetonitrile 2:1, two main products were formed deriving from the formation of a quinone methide 2M4MQ subsequently trapped by either H2O2 or H2O to form a benzylic hydroperoxide or alcohol, respectively. When nucleophiles such as GSH or a peptide containing a cysteine residue (Pep-Cys) were present in the reaction medium, the quinone methide 2M4MQ was trapped by the more nucleophilic thiol function to form thio-adducts. No modifications of 2M4MP were observed when the same reactions were carried out without HRP confirming that the activation of the molecule was enzyme related. Amino nucleophiles were shown to be far less reactive towards the quinone methide 2M4MQ with only tiny formation of adducts with lysine or arginine side chains.

Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of \u03b2-catenin mRNA demonstrated that induction of FSH\u03b2 mRNA by GnRH depended on \u03b2-catenin and that regulation of FSH\u03b2 by \u03b2-catenin occurred independently of the JNK-c-jun pathway. \u03b2-Catenin depletion had no impact on FSH\u03b2 mRNA stability. In L\u03b2T2 cells transfected with FSH\u03b2 promoter luciferase fusion constructs, GnRH responsiveness was conferred by the proximal promoter (-944/-1) and was markedly decreased by \u03b2-catenin knockdown. However, none of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor binding sites in that region were required for promoter activation by GnRH. Chromatin immunoprecipitation further corroborated the absence of direct interaction between \u03b2-catenin and the 1.8-kb FSH\u03b2 promoter. To elucidate the mechanism for the \u03b2-catenin effect, we analyzed approximately 1 billion reads of next-generation RNA sequencing \u03b2-catenin knockdown assays and selected the nuclear cofactor breast cancer metastasis-suppressor 1-like (Brms1L) as one candidate for further study. Subsequent experiments confirmed that Brms1L mRNA expression was decreased by \u03b2-catenin knockdown as well as by JNK inhibition. Furthermore, knockdown of Brms1L significantly attenuated GnRH-induced FSH\u03b2 expression. Thus, our findings indicate that the expression of Brms1L depends on \u03b2-catenin activity and contributes to FSH\u03b2 induction by GnRH.", "anno": [[118, 119, true], [205, 206, true], [289, 290, true], [374, 375, true], [513, 514, true], [733, 734, true], [791, 792, true], [986, 987, true], [1122, 1123, true], [1255, 1256, true], [1533, 1534, true], [1661, 1662, true], [1749, 1750, true], [1880, 1881, true]]}, {"id": 23375227, "text": "C34-epi and C34-epi-C35-trifluoro analogues of solamin, a mono-THF annonaceous acetogenin, were synthesized.

These concerns, however, originated from early studies and case reports that were inadequately controlled and designed. Recently, the concern of using ketamine in these patients has been challenged by a number of published studies demonstrating that the use of ketamine was safe in these patients. AIMS: The purpose of this article was to review the current literature in regards to using ketamine in patients with traumatic brain injuries in different clinical settings associated with anesthesia, as well as review the potential mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of ketamine. RESULTS: Studies examining the use of ketamine for induction, maintenance, and sedation in patients with TBI have had promising results. The use of ketamine in a controlled ventilation setting and in combination with other sedative agents has demonstrated no increase in ICP.

The discovery of constitutive activation of the BRAF kinase caused by activating BRAF(V600E) kinase mutation in most melanoma patients led to the discovery of the first potent BRAF(V600E) signaling inhibitor, vemurafenib. Vemurafenib was effective in treating advanced melanoma patients and was proposed for the treatment of other BRAF(V600E) mutant cancers as well. Unfortunately, the success of vemurafenib was hampered by the rapid development of acquired resistance in different types of BRAF(V600E) mutant cancer cells. It becomes important to identify and evaluate all of the potential mechanisms of cellular resistance to vemurafenib. In this study, we characterized the interactions of vemurafenib with three major ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2. We found that vemurafenib stimulated the ATPase activity and potently inhibited drug efflux mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2. Vemurafenib also restored drug sensitivity in ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Moreover, we revealed that in the presence of functional ABCG2, BRAF kinase inhibition by vemurafenib is reduced in BRAF(V600E) mutant A375 cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that ABCG2 confers resistance to vemurafenib in A375 cells, suggesting involvement of this transporter in acquired resistance to vemurafenib. Thus, combination chemotherapy targeting multiple pathways could be an effective therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired resistance to vemurafenib for cancers harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation.", "anno": [[113, 114, true], [335, 336, true], [480, 481, true], [638, 639, true], [755, 756, true], [901, 902, true], [1022, 1023, true], [1096, 1097, true], [1243, 1244, true], [1423, 1424, true], [1620, 1621, true]]}, {"id": 23525524, "text": "RATIONALE: The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a site critical for the actions of many drugs of abuse. Psychoactive compounds, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, modify gamma (40-90) and high frequency oscillations (HFO, 130-180\u00a0Hz) in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in the NAc. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) are serotonergic hallucinogens and activation of 5HT2A receptors likely underlies their hallucinogenic effects. Whether these compounds can also modulate LFP oscillations in the NAc is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the effect of serotonergic hallucinogens on gamma and HFO recorded in the NAc and to test whether 5HT2A receptors mediate the effects observed. METHODS: LFPs were recorded from the NAc of freely moving rats. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally. RESULTS: LSD (0.03-0.3\u00a0mg/kg) and DOI (0.5-2.0\u00a0mg/kg) increased the power and reduced the frequency of HFO. In contrast, the hallucinogens produced a robust reduction in the power of low (40-60\u00a0Hz), but not high gamma oscillations (70-90\u00a0Hz). MDL 11939 (1.0\u00a0mg/kg), a 5HT2A receptor antagonist, fully reversed the changes induced by DOI on HFO but only partially for the low gamma band. Equivalent increases in HFO power were observed after TCB-2 (5HT2A receptor agonist, 0.1-1.5\u00a0mg/kg), but not CP 809101 (5H2C receptor agonist, 0.1-3\u00a0mg/kg). Notably, hallucinogen-induced increases in HFO power were smaller than those produced by ketamine (25\u00a0mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Serotonergic hallucinogen-induced changes in HFO and gamma are mediated, at least in part, by stimulation of 5HT2A receptors. Comparison of the oscillatory changes produced by serotonergic hallucinogens and NMDAR antagonists are also discussed.", "anno": [[9, 10, true], [96, 97, true], [304, 305, true], [491, 492, true], [573, 574, true], [584, 585, true], [755, 756, true], [764, 765, true], [819, 820, true], [862, 863, true], [871, 872, true], [970, 971, true], [1105, 1106, true], [1249, 1250, true], [1406, 1407, true], [1516, 1517, true], [1529, 1530, true], [1655, 1656, true], [1774, 1775, true]]}, {"id": 22817767, "text": "The purpose of this study is to discuss the surgical treatment for ovarian torsion in children and adolescents with a focus on the procedures of adnexal conservation surgery and its frequency in the literature of the last 10 years.
